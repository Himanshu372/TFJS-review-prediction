"Very pleased with my machine
Variation of weight of the load is very good
Also the time save is useful
Large drum
Glad I purchased it",Approved
"Bought product as we like the way it looks, unfussy design and easy to keep clean. It does a great job cooking the food as well : ) Very pleased with purchase and would recommend to anyone.",Approved
"Easy to use, with touch control technology for immediate response . Water boils so fast, but then you can reduce the heat to simmer without everything boiling over. The hob is so easy to keep clean, just a quick wipe with a damp cloth.  
A new feature on this hob is the hob2hood,  sensor which automatically works with your cooker hob. If your cooker hob does not have the sensor, your hob will still light up so that you know to Manually adjust the speed on the hob, no more steamy kitchen!",Approved
Thanks for letting me testing ! Great way excellent and interactive,Rejected
"Superb product except for one drawback - the sound level of the alarm.  Even standing next to it, it is barely audible to anyone but our dogs.  No facility to change the level either.    Other than this, I love the space, the central zone is especially useful, having a minute minder on the hob is good (even if I can’t hear the alarm); the control of the heat is excellent and the speed the zones heat up is amazing.  And I have had to get rid of only two pans - one of which was described as anodised aluminium suitable for induction hobs but when I tried it I got the “fault” icon up.  So beware.",Approved
Works well although wide range of heating scale seems unnecessary. Lack of information on removing access cover to enable electrical connection.,Approved
This is an amazing appliance which has changed our lives in cooking! Fantastic.,Approved

"What a fantastic oven, pure simple and easy to use",Approved
"Purchased 2 of these ovens from Wickes. The soft close feature did not work on one of the ovens. Had a second delivered and it was dented, the grill was hanging down and the rubber was hanging off the door. The soft close on the second Oven which was working has now ceased to work and we havent even plugged it in yet. We have spent just under £4000 on AEG appliances so as you can imagine we are not happy. Still awaiting ovens that work!",Rejected
"This is my second AEG washing machine. It is beautiful looking, easy to use and is very much better economy wise. It has lots of features which I am thrilled with. Highly recommended.",Approved
I really like the time save on this product when you have a small load.,Approved
"Oven feels solid and build quality is good. The main drawback with this product is that the temperature control is a dial with the temperature settings shown at 50 degree intervals and it is very difficult to get an accurate temperate setting which can result in food being over or under cooked.
As time goes on you do get used to this but this oven could have scored above average if it had a better temperature control system",Approved

"Since buying our AEG Washing Machine we have been very impressed with the machine; the features it has and with the quality of product compared with other brands. The extended guarantee they offered at no extra cost is very comforting and the annual service contract is definitely worth signing up for. When I bought a stacking kit to put our dryer on top, it was also sent by courier that same day. Unpacking it, again showed the quality of goods as it is so solid it will hold our dryer in place even during the most rigorous spinning vibrations. Just wished we had bought our machine much sooner so we could have benefitted from such a reliable, yet smart looking machine. AEG's good reputation is deserved and why many customers like myself will continue to buy their products in future.",Approved
Where to start single oven with a huge capacity probably the biggest I've ever seen in a single oven you can get so much in this team feature is absolutely amazing and so much moisture two your food or you can simply just steam excellent piece of equipment the auto clean function is also very handy and works very well I can truly say the best oven I've ever owned I'm a great lover of the AEG brand and that is all I buy,Approved
disappointed that there isn't accurate temperature numbers in-between the normal (i50 200) otherwise good all rounder,Approved

"We purchased the oven unit as a replacement for old unit which, to be fair, gave us 20 years of faultless service, after looking around several stores and looking at different manufacturers and models, we decided to try Zanussi.
good value, good looks and works well, knobs buttons and the like all operate well and are easy to use and understand.",Approved
"Bought to replace an old LG that flooded the kitchen.  I've tried a lot of the programs, and honestly I've got to say it's amazing.  It's so quiet and everything comes out well washed and amazingly clean.  Comparing this machine to all the other machines I've owned over the years.  Happy with the 5 year guarantee offered, and I hope to get a good 10+ years use from it, if other customers experiences of AEG are right.",Approved

"We love how this cooker cooks food to the minute of instructions on food packaging. It is spot on! 
Every cooker I have had in the past over or under cooks your food. 
Also the induction is amazing. Even when something boils over no burning or stains to the top of the cooker! 
I love this cooker well worth every penny!",Approved
"After 1.5 years WM started to take ages to finish, always started another circle. Needed specialist to reset programming (if I understand right), my usual appliance repair guy couldn't sort it reason :
being too much electronics. expensive parts, trial and error when ordering these parts tricky. In this case it was ok as I called out AEG specialist on guarantee, but if it happens outside of guarantee period I can just as well scrap wm instantly as these specialists are expensive. Teaches me to go for simpler models next time that do not require specialized programming knowledge! Most appliance specialists will not be computer experts at the same time.",Approved

"The temperature dials need additional calibration so that you don't have to guess it between the 50 degree ones shown. The timer bleeper is far to quiet, you can barely hear it in the kitchen, even less chance if the radio is on and no chance in another room; we are having to buy a separate timer for this. The top oven does warm up quickly, less so when using the grill function. Not the best of our four Zanusi products.",Approved
The front cover by the soap dispenser is not great - already the corner has come away from the panel. 2 weeks use. Not as good as my last machine but this one is electronic which I’m not used to. Washes well so far big drum and quiet. Would have like an 1800 spin but don’t think many do now,Approved
"Quick and easy to use - and clean, but best of all cooks cakes and bread very evenly, no more lopsided cakes or soggy bottoms. Marked down one star on quality due to noise from cooling fan.",Approved

"Early days to comment as only when it came to writing this did we solve one problem we have had.

The 'Manual' that came with the cooker is totally inadequate.
We followed the instructions to thoroughly clean the cooker before use. When it came to replacing the glass panels of the main oven we found there were three slots for the two panels. The manual although claiming to be for the 47102V-MN says there are variations in models and there may be two or three panels. Are we one short as delivered? And if not, which slot is not used? The manual drawing is not clear.

The main oven door catch doesn't work correctly frequently leaving the door loose with a gap on the right hand side between the glass and the seal. There doesn't appear to be any adjustment possible.

With regard to the top oven.
The shelf positions in the drawing in the manual differ from those in the oven causing confusion as the shelves can fit in four positions not three. 

The major drawback is the lack of a control for the grill. Choosing a shelf to control heat is not a satisfactory answer.",Approved

Engineer visited again and spare control unit on order, now waiting for the repair to be done. Consequently, am not happy with the build quality.",Approved
"Looks nice and cooks well, only issue is the knobs push in when not in use and one of mine sometimes will not come back out again so I have to leave them in the out possition all the time.",Approved
It looks good and has impressive feature; and does an excellent job.,Approved
"Bought this 3 weeks ago when my old oven expired. Very pleased with features, not tested cleaning feature yet.
Not sure about the usefulness of the ""count up"" feature, it makes minute minder a bit fiddly to set when oven is on. Also, ""true"" fan cooking, is obviously fan cooking, so why not call it that.
Heats up very quickly, and seems very efficient.",Approved
"I bought this hob to replace a gas one and I am delighted with it. It heats up rapidly but also maintains a low heat when required. I love the added facility to heat up rapidly and automatically turn down to the chosen cooking temperature.
It is very easy to clean and it looks fantastic too.",Approved

Decided to push the boat out a year ago and replace my second Belling with this which sounded good and I thought it would be superior to a  Belling. However I have been disappointed as the main oven door doesn't seem to fit. After a lot of hassle got it seen to by a lad who didn't specialise in AEGs who replaced the door which is even worse and is only double glazed. I find the main oven poor unless the fan is on. Also one knob seems too loose and is easy to knock onto a higher temperature. Quality of the knobs is poor as the paint is already rubbing off. The ceramic top has marked already. I don't find it especially easy to keep the ovens clean. I am currently mustering up the strength to contact Currys again with these problems .,Rejected

"Lovely looking oven. Very easy to use, straight forward to operate with good clear instructions. The hob is excellent as it detects the size of pan used rather than trying to match a pan to the ring size. Much easier to clean than my last hob which,when wiping with a cloth would randomly switch everything on & off. I only gave four stars for design as the vents for the ovens make condensation on the wall above the hob. Not ideal.",Approved
Excellent washing machine at a good price and the bonus of a 5 year guarantee within the price.,Approved
"Very quick, saves electricity, instant control, no waiting to heat up, no burnt on food and safe with children around.
One design issue - this is our second one in just over two years as we accidently cracked the hob on our first one on the front right hand corner as there is no protection around edge of hob and it is slightly raised up due to the sealing gasket so is quite vulnerable on the corners.",Approved
"This hob certainly warrants the premium price point, it screams high quality even before you turn it on.

Functionally, this hob has been a pleasure to use so far, bringing all the bells and whistles to the party. From the responsive touch sensitivity to the power boost function and extremely convenient built in timer this hob performs flawlessly.

"The choice of programmes and quietness of the washing programmes is very good. It is easy to use and the ability to reduce wash times and change temperature setting is very useful. However I have found the drying programmes are very noisy as the drain pump is constantly operating which is very different to my last Miele machine. I was concerned that the drain pump was faulty as the reviews of this machine mention how quiet it is, but the engineer sent out by AEG confirmed that this is normal with the latest machines. It is a shame as it ruins what is otherwise a good machine.
The machine is very deep and needs more than the 60cm stated in the brochure if fitting between existing kitchen units.",Approved
Got this brand after a long research and recommendations from few friends and family who owned one. Got the big capacity 9kg (unfortunately the 10kg was £150 more expensive) being a family of 5 and a big drum definitely deliver better cleaning. It weights automatically the load so if too heavy you got the opportunity to remove some clothes (but you can still go ahead with it but not recommended ).The spin is a bit noisier then what I expected but the machine is solid on the floor and even at its highest speed do not move of a single millimeter! But got a night programme for an extra quite wash if you need to use it at night. I like the eco option for an environment friendly use and the flexibility of the speed wash that gives you the opportunity to choose how long that program is going to be (on selected programmes only). Useful the 2 seconds bips at the end so there is no time to wait to open the door. Also great feature is the 3kg 20mns wash for that piece of school uniform left behind and needed the same morning! Wash comes out really clean and fresh and noticed I don't need the same amount of washing powder as previous machine so now I reduced the dose (another tick for the environment!). The little lip that flicks up and down in the draw for the option of the liquid and powder soap (I use the powder for the whites and the liquid for the coloured as suggested) is a good idea as you don't see the liquid disappear inside the machine. Haven't used yet the steam selection or any of the delicate programmes but looking forward to it as got lots of woollen garments and one of the main reason why I have chosen this model is the fact that is approved by the wool trade company. Really hope it will be a long lasting relationship!,Approved

"I ordered this machine on 24th August 2014, delivered one week later. I chose it over a similar level German brand but paid an additional premium for what I thought was a reliable quality product. It's let us down twice in a little over 3 months and we haven't had it working since 10th December 2014. Today we are still waiting on a call back from the service provider in the UK to fix it. apparently 1 of the 4 parts needed to fix it is out of stock. Christmas with a young family and no washing machine is no fun when you down the launderette every couple of days. I work in Quality for a super luxurious motor car company in the south of England so have extensive experience of suppliers and building a Quality product. This is not what I expect from someone like AEG. The retailer hasn't given much support and I've only had 2 call backs since reporting the fault on December 10th to discuss the issue.

First time I have had a Washer/Dryer. Did a lot of research as to which product to buy. AEG came out on top. It is very quiet when washing - I keep forgetting I have put it on. I have used various programs and like the 60 min wash/dry. The machine calculates drying time for you but you still can control it. If you try to program something you can't do it will let you know with an ERR message. So far really happy with it and have already recommended it.,Approved
"Everything is great. Cleaning power, spin cycles, drying, build quality, etc. The main issue seems to be how it distributes weight. For example if I put 4 towels in, I get knocks and thuds coming and going as it goes through the various cycles. So it's hours of noise that can be heard throughout the house. The actual spinning is very quiet. But when it's at a medium spin speed there's a very loud thud/bang repeatedly. I've had an engineer out to confirm there's nothing wrong with it. Very disappointed, as the apparent quietness due to the quiet spin is let down by the distribution function, allowing all sorts of thuds. Maybe the more expensive AEG machines don't have this problem, as it is the cheaper of the AEG range. If you can find a place to put it where the noise won't bother you, like an annex on the house, then shouldn't be any problem.",Approved
"Purchased this washer dryer due to store recommendation and a good Christmas sale offer. The features are good and the sensing technooligy is great for reducing the time needed for washing and drying for the perfect time. The inverter motor is the main reason I bought it as I wanted something nice and quiet however, the pump makes such a loud aweful chugging noise when filling with water, is completely silent when washing, then the aweful noise comes back when on the spin cycle and continues right until the end. The same noise happens on the drying cycle.",Approved

A very stylish hob which is easy to operate and to clean. Responsive controls and good features,Approved
The spin programme is very good and the machine is easy to use very pleased,Approved
Quieter than previous model that we have had for many years. Only slight criticism is that the compartment that houses the drawer that holds the washing liquids is hard to clean out easily,Approved
Very happy with it but I would prefer a smaller grill pan. I find the one supplied to be too heavy and cumbersome even with a small quantity of food.,Approved

"I am so happy with this cooker, it replaced another electric cooker which was less than three years old and an absolute nightmare to use, this cooker is a dream .

So easy to clean.

I wholeheartedly recommend this cooker, you will not be disappointed.",Approved
"My 23yr old Belling died and dreaded replacement. Installed myself, easy mains connection at rear. Clock setup easy unless your not used to smart tech. The cooker is very smart. Will enhance any kitchen. Duo rings + various pot diameter rings on a very fast hob. Be careful don't turn to max 9, way too hot and fast. You shut the door for grilling. At first thought daft. It's not!! It's excellent cos sausages, bacon all cook moist instead of burnt on top. It grills twice as fast as the open door types and much nicer. Both ovens are faster by 20 or 30 % and cooks evenly. Pizza base oven is a bit gimmicky but it works! Thin pizzas are like takeaway quality and fast. Hob heat warning lights useful. Timer only works on main oven which is a pain, why not both? Lots of trays. Grill pan? Not sure about design. It slides in the side rails instead of grill trays. When pulled out its a bit unstable. Decide to use my old pan in top oven and theirs in main. Aside from that it's the best cooker av owned and the JLewis deal was great. Cooker came with 5 yr warranty for peace of mind",Rejected

A very quiet washer dryer. The time saver programme is a great addition. The capacity is ok for 2 of us but I think you would need a bigger drum for more people.,Approved
This is a great product so far. Does what it says very well. Extremely quiet for a 10 kg machine. My last one was a Siemens and boy did that make a noise.,Approved

Being a compact dish washer is ok for it to be relatively small. Compared to other brands anyway the space in this one is not very well organized and its quite hard to fully load it using the racks at the best.,Approved

MY PREVIOUS AEG WASHING MACHINE 12 YEARS NOT AN ISSUE. FINGERS CROSSED THE SAME,Approved
Really good product  makes me want to go out and buy one,Rejected
"Not only do you have sufficient programmes but within these programmes you have more choices such as temperature, spin speed etc. The programmes I have experienced in the past were very restricted in this way. The quality of the wash is excellent. The thing that amazed me was the noise it makes whilst in use. Or should I say lack of noise, so quiet and smooth. The economy rating is also something that I look for these days and this machine is something that I am proud to own!
Ticks all of my boxes. Well done AEG! I will certainly look for this brand next time I need to buy an electrical item.",Approved
Although these are knwon to leak and faulter after a period I have been more than happy with this product and woudl recommend. I had mine for at least 5 years before any faults showed and then it lasted another year before I replace with another one,Approved
"Lots of nice features to explore on this oven as I have only just had to fitted, but the telescopic rails are a disaster. I'm sure they'd work well if you could only fit them. Way too small and too stiff to put on the existing rails. You could possibly fit them with brute force (and a hammer?!) but what damage would you do to the oven? Oh, and you have to go through the same rigmarole every time you want to use the pyrolytic clean as they need to come out. Bit disappointed with them, hence the rating.",Approved

"Have bought AEG products for over 40 years because of build quality and reliability. We are pleased with the range of features and solidity of this cooker. However we are not happy about the fact neither grill can be controlled - just turned on or off, Also disappointed that the grill pan came with no handle. We appreciate the manual gives guidelines on times for grilling different items and adjusting the shelf level but this is no substitute for the lack of control. We make great use of the grill and not being able to turn it down is a problem. Because of this we would certainly not buy this cooker again.",Approved

Looking on the Which website I selected this this AEG Electric Cooker because it was a best buy. After using the cooker the quality of buildease of use and cooking results are just what I wanted. Not a cheap cooker but definitely value for money. Plus AEG's confidence on their product you get a 5 year guarantee. What more would you want!,Approved
"A fantastic addition to our new kitchen , just gone open plan and didn't want an unsightly unit hanging from the ceiling",Approved
that impressed with our cooker we are changing our washing machine and yes aeg if it is as good as the cooker we will be happy it arrives this saturday .a aeg fan,Approved
"When you buy a new oven your never really know what you are going to get, this is why I spent a while researching AEG. What did people think, what were their products like. I bought one and all that I can say is that it is a fantastic product; both ovens cook evenly, features are great and really work and visibility so good that my dog likes to watch things cooking!",Approved
"I have been using this cooker every day since it was installed and still discovering how to get the best from it for my cooking. I love the dual fuel aspect, it is so nice to have instant heat on the hob when I need it and to be able to turn it off instantly without the fear of burning or drying out food which can happen with electric hobs. It is easier to clean too.",Approved
I was surprised how quick water is boiling compare with my old ceramic hob. Good control level of power cooking.,Approved
"I love my new machine. Very easy to use. Excellent programmes with a choice of spin. 1400 spin is great. My last machine was a John Lewis which I believe was made by AEG, lasted 8 years and well used.",Approved
There are four main speeds but then there is a fifth option which is so low you can hardly hear it and it switches off automatically after 1 hour so I use it for when I have finished cooking and it removes any remaining smells. Fantastic.,Approved
I am still learning about the hob but it does things that amaze me. Changed from a gas hob and glad l did. Always looks good and so easy to clean.,Approved
"No issues, boils a pot of water very quickly, controls easy to use.",Approved

This is our second AEG double oven and have had zero iss7es in the 12 years of owning!!,Approved
good looking and easy to use. fan oven is the best I've ever had. love the sliding shelves,Approved
"Had an AEG washing machine many years ago and when it came to buying a new one, I looked carefully at AEG and their high quality competitors.

This machine is smarter than an Oxford professor, better looking than a model and oozes quality on a par with Mercedes, BMW and Jaguar! 

Whilst the washing cycle is a bit long, the clothes come out very clean, dry and taken care off. I love the steam feature which is reducing my ironing! I've only used a few of the programs so far and will explore the others over the next 5 years (length of the warranty!). The machine is efficient in terms of electricity, water and noise. 

Overall whilst higher priced than many other manufacturers, you ultimately get more for your money and something that should last a lot longer.

Note: I don't work for AEG or any associated company, just love their current product range.",Approved
"Great range of wash settings, which can also be adjusted to suit, quiet, quick and simple to use. I love the steam feature which is great for shirts and linen items. We have a new baby so its on pretty much every day and i'm really happy with it, I would defo look at A E G for other products in future and have suggested this machine to friends who are also in the market for a new washing machine. Best washing machine we have had by far, and we have had a few!",Approved
Brilliantly easy to use. Good suction. Vacuum cleaning is fun now! I wish the hand-held part had a longer nozzle for the side of cushions.,Approved
"I'm not a culinary expert, nor interested in such, but I'm very pleased so far although the instructions were more complicated than I expected. I still have to learn the symbols & settings as I have no patience for such matters.",Approved
A fantastic product to my kitchen. Easy to use and heats up so quickly. Would def recommend.,Approved
Thanks for letting me testing ! Innovative and useful.,Rejected
"An excellent machine, particularly like the way it mixes the powder before it washes and also how you can see exactly how much your load weighs as you load it. It is also very quiet. My favourite new gadget.",Approved
Had the oven delevered new 4 weeks ago but the bottom oven does not work. An engineer visited but couldn’t find the fault so has ordered a new circuit board but we haven’t heard back since . What do I expect ? A replacement oven and an apology. On the bright side it’s been a boon for those of us on diets,Rejected
Had the oven for 1 month now and have found no issues with it. We like the retractable shelf for ease of use. Still need the book every now and then to get the right oven setup but we've found our food has cooked as expected,Approved
The fish was cooked perfectly and totally different to the texture you would get using a normal oven.,Approved
"This machine is reliable, economical and very effective. It has a wide range of features and a massive drum that fits in a surprisingly large amount of washing.",Approved
"Product performs very well. What a pity the temperature gauges are printed round the knob, so anyone who is quite short or elderly cannot read them ! Even I at 5'6"" are struggling.",Approved
A very good oven and very easy to use and not badly priced,Approved
Great technology - different programmes and features to cover all eventualities. Easy to use with clear instructions.,Approved
My washing machine was installed on 11 August and it stopped working after 10 days. I have been waiting for 3 weeks for an engineer from the Pacifica group to fix it. I contacted them this morning and they told me that my appointment has been cancelled. This is the worst experience I have ever had in regard to purchasing an electrical appliance.,Rejected
"All features fulfill my expectations, although a 40 minutes cycle would be ideal for me.",Approved
"We have always wanted an induction cooker and the failure of several rings on our old ceramic hob cooker prompted us to look at purchasing one.
We looked at other (cheaper) cookers but decided the extra spend was worth it for the AEG version as it looked better and had more features. Suffice to say after a few steep learning curves we are very pleased with the cooker.
If you are new to induction it does take a little while to get used to the speed to bring things to temp - usually this is rapid but is quite easily controllable. Even the ovens seem to cook things quicker which is good once you are used to the new timings you need to use.

The only minor niggle is the grill does not have a split facility - it is the whole area or nothing.

So you get a rapid cooker with plenty of information to let you know what is happening - good features and a design that is modern and uncluttered. What more could you ask for?",Approved
"I’m really happy to have this product. A lot of people were not recommended both wash and dry functions in one device, but it works absolutely perfect. No problem with the difference of the kgs I can wash and dry, never had do take out something and continue with drying part of the clothes. I live it.",Approved
I purchased this to replace an old machine as this had a great rating from Which? and was on sale at John Lewis. It washes very quietly and even when spinning you can still have a conversation at normal levels without the machine intruding. It has great capacity and flexibility although I have noticed that on small loads it can struggle to spin - it seems to try then stop and tumble the clothes for a bit and then try again. It doesn't happen often and only seems to be one time out of ten on the shorter programs so not really a big deal. Otherwise it is a great machine and I am very happy with it so far.,Rejected
"Very good performance. Only downside is that when washing a full load, the machine will not drain the load satisfactorily and you have to restart on drain/spin with half the load only (twice).",Approved
AEG still delivers the quality and performance we have come to expect of this (once) German manufacturer ( item made in Poland). Well built; excellent washing outcomes; quiet; plenty of useable programmes; fairly quick cycles and good looking. More than one could expect from a sub-£500 machine (when cashbacks etc. have been activated).,Approved
"The machine looks good and generally performs well. The touch button controls for temperature, spin speed, additional functions and to start the machine are very fussy and work about 25% first time. The door handle has been set offset from the latch and so it feels like you are bending the door to open it. The machine takes a good load and is quieter than expected.",Approved
"The washing performance is excellent although it is disappointing that the high spin speed of 1600 is not easy to set up as a stand-alone short program.
The controls are a mixture of push buttons and touch buttons and this can be rather perplexing, especially as the touch buttons sensitivity seems to vary - touching a touch button a couple of times can sometimes send the display whirling through a rapid succession of displayed figures while other times the touch seems little responsive. 
My previous AEG which lasted 18 years was far simpler to operate and just as good!",Approved
"We had a 15 year Servis fridge which we use daily never let us down but had become rusty and when the wife wanted anew kitchen we decided to change the fridge and freezer. The new Zanussi ZRG16600WA in my opinion is not as good as the old Servis fridge which had for wire shelves and two plastic glass separate shelves for holding salads, the new Zanussi only has three glass shelves and one single salad drawer not enough we are not big eaters but do like to shop on a fortnightly bases the new Zanussi doesn`t allow this perhaps this is what it was made for more weekly shop than usual. The door was swop over that is easy to do but for storage i wish we had gone for a larger fridge but that would have been more money as our Servis fridge was the same money 15 years ago.",Approved
Absolutely delighted with my new cooker. First time using an electric cooker and love the quick responses and accurate temperatures. Amazed by the speed of the induction hob and high degree of control. Easy to keep clean and the style and quality shine through.,Approved
"My first AEG washing machine which I’m delighted with ( I’ve always had Bosch).My house is very open plan & I wanted a machine that was reasonably quiet & this is very quiet- at first I checked to make sure it was still running! Features that I particularly like are: the ‘Time save’ option which reduces the length of wash considerably & the clothes still come out very clean: the 20min 3kg wash - really useful, choice if spin speed and the time delay. As yet, I’ve not tried the other options but so far I’m delighted with my machine. Should have bought one years ago! Thoroughly recommended!",Approved
"Great machine, the best modern function is that it weighs your load and adjust the wash time accordingly, fantastic time saving feacture.",Approved
"It hs only been installed for two weeks and am yet to make a souffle or cook my Christmas cakes. I like the induction hob which I find easy to keep clean, the two ovens I know will be very useful and both are quite a good size and suitable for times when all the family come. 
The only problem I have had is understanding the instruction book, it would have been a good idea to have including a DVD with the instructions on how to use this cooker.",Approved
"Good power, lightweight, easy to use, good design. I Like the small easy to use vacuum which can be easily dismantled from the main vacuum and chargjng base is easy to use",Approved
"Love the size of the machines drum as a result been able to reduce how many wash loads done each week , lots of sensible programs to choose from with the option to reduce the time of wash program don’t use all available options but glad they are available",Approved
Great range of variable washing and drying options. Fantastic load size and spin speed. Fits surprisingly well in my cramped kitchen. Looks really smart. Easy to use. Washes and dries well. Pretty quiet too.,Approved
"Great machine, host of options and most importantly quiet. We love the 60 minute wash and dry setting.",Approved
It does exactly what it should. Wash clothes. All our kitchen appliances are AEG.,Approved
This is the second Aeg washing machine I have had & this new model is amazing.all the features that I require,Approved
"Nice and quiet even under spin cycles, could do with more spin selection as 800 is still to fast for delicates.",Approved
I cant see what difference the steam programme makes..don't like that you can't choose to use the 1600 spin speed when you want .and id rather the automatic start wasn't there as the machine can start very quickly on a programme you don't require. The print on the choice panel could do with being bigger. Otherwise a good washing machine.delivery was excellnt. living in this part of the world we normally get penalised for delivary. Thank you John Lewis.,Approved
"This hob has 5 heat zones but with plenty of space between them so you can use a large saucepan on each at the same time.
The hob heats up quickly and the heat is consistent once it is up at temperature. there is a good range of heat levels and the rapid boil works efficiently.
The surface is easy to clean and looks smart.",Approved
"I had coveted this cooker for a while so was excited to finally get it. It's beautifully designed and all seemed in order. However, once it had been installed and the guys had left, I turned the burners on and lo and behold, one of the burners would not ignite. I tried to trouble shoot the problem per the instructions, but I wasn't able to resolve the problem. I've tried several times to get through to Currys, where I purchased it from, but have had no luck with that either. This is an expensive appliance and I shouldn't have to chase them to get this resolved. Shame! Although I've said I would recommend this appliance, I would always give a caveat based on this problem.",Rejected
Don't get me wrong this is great but two small problems. 1 it does no fill the mug full enough. 2 there is no sensor / warning to let you know the bean are running out. Other than that it makes excellent coffee.,Approved
"I PURCHASED AEG ""FOR ENGINEERING AT ITS BEST"" BUT MADE IN CHINA! CHEEPNESS AT ITS LOWEST PRICE! . MIGHT AS WELL PAID FOR A CHEAP CHINESE MIXER. TO GET SERVICE IN THE UK IS A JOKE. I WAS ASKED TO VIDEO OF MYSELF TRYING TO TURN MY MIXER ON, AND SEND IT TO THE SERVICE COMPANY ""ELECTROLUX"" A JOKE! A COMPLETE JOKE",Rejected
"Very impressed with our new washing machine. Stylish, quiet and very easy to use. Good size drum capacity and the Steam function is particularly useful - anything that cuts down the ironing! Would definitely recommend it - a great all rounder.",Rejected
Having recently purchased an AEG microwave and fan oven I had no hesitation choosing an AEG ceramic hob to replace one that had developed a fault. My confidence was repaid in spades - It ticks all the boxes and is also very economical because of the double ring - giving what is basically a 4 ring hob and extra 5th ring. It heats up extremely quickly - which again represents a saving - I cannot recommend this hob highly enough.,Approved
"Intuitive to use easy understandable selection and displays. The displays show exactly what you have selected without the need of several switches just one selector does the job even for a novice this is easy.
Quiet in operation and so far low on electrical power usage.",Approved
"We recently needed to changed our washing machine following the disintegration of our Hotpoint. Having been amazed at the aray of new machines, sizes, speeds, additional features etc, we opted for an AEG. This was based upon the efficency, features and cost of the machine. We have been pleasantly surprised by the ease of use, quietness and effectiveness of the wash. These are all much improved on our old machine and so it feels like a good investment.",Approved
We have had an AEG washer / dryer that was fantastic and lasted 10 years so we thought we’d get another. Really happy with our purchase and looks great.,Approved
"Laundry never been so clean! I have been very impressed by how much better this machine is compared to my old AEG, which I thought was good. It's also very quiet and so far hasn't moved a mm!

It has taken time to adjust to the longer cycle time and which programmes to use and I still have to understand all it can do, but basics are easy to understand. I think I would find an online video helpful, so I can fully maximise the use of all its capabilities!",Approved
"Really loving this washer-dryer, really please with it. I read many reviews and have
found that they were accurate.",Approved
I just love all of it no hard cleaning the oven the gas hob is great to,Approved
The cooker has proved itself in a whole range of things from everyday cooking to baking this years Christmas cake. We like the bigger top oven compared to our previous cooker and the wok ring is great for the wok but will also come into its own for jam and preserve making.,Approved
"I am pleased with the product but it's too expensive for what it is.
If it stays reliable I will be happy",Approved
"A good product, but more short wash programmes would be nice. The soap drawer is also difficult to open, which for such an expensive machine is disappointing. The wash quality is good, and it is a very quiet machine.",Approved
"Energy efficient, water low user. Clothes always perfectly clean and dry. Can't fault product, features or design. Silent and effective. Defo recommended. Eco features and time saving same quality compared to full programe. Best investment i made in 2017.",Approved
"We are really happy with our new oven, it works well and the controls are easy to understand.",Approved
"Early days yet. Finding it a little complicated compared to my previous (much older, different manufaturer) machine, but has so far performed very well and would recommend it",Approved
"I find the washer dryer amazing, it's quiet, sounds like rain drops when its washing the motor is that silent.",Approved
"Great machine - high quality build and very quiet, very pleased.",Approved
Bought this cooker because the oven temperatures on the old one was getting erratic. AEG update fills the bill really well - fingertip control of everything - the hob heats and cools almoust instantaneously - Fantastic!,Approved
I like this product. It works great and it consum only little energy.,Approved
"It was good when it worked but 6 weeks ago the dryer part stopped working. The following week the appointed repairer came and found fault code ""EEC"" It has taken over a month with me chasing them every week for them to find out what this code means. They have now said they will come next week and try to fix it.
I sent an email to AEG asking if they could help, but they didn't even reply.
I should have kept with Bxxxh and suggest you keep clear of this machine as when it goes wrong you could be in for a long wait before they can fix it.",Rejected
"Programmes take longer but get so much in on one wash ! Washes really well including my sofa covers , very pleased with results and 1600 spin bonus for towels and sheets .",Approved
The wife has now gotten use to this machine and finds it extremely good.,Approved
This machine is super quiet and many settings to choose from. Very happy with results so far!,Approved
"A very good dishwasher, so much better than my last one which was fitted in my new house. There is often a better way to do it and this certainly is it!",Approved
I have found the induction hob very easy to use even though I am not a high tech person,Approved
Nice product with a contemporary design / finish .,Approved
An excellent washing machine with an easy front access door . Washes very well but the programs can be long but there is a washbtime reduction button which is useful. Hope it lasts 9 years like our last AEG washing machine,Approved
"Good price/quality ratio. Efficient washing and drying.
We like a lot the fact that the time gets updated automatically depending on the wash weight.",Approved
"Easy to use, quiet, efficient my first aeg product, I bought washing machine and tumble dryer together I’m very happy with my purchase",Approved
"We have had our AEG Induction cooker for years, which has served us well. When completely out of the blue the hob part simply stopped working. Having there great 5 year warrenty solved the problem as they simply replaced it with this slightly newer model. Getting to know the new controls has been the only thing to overcome. This done we are happy as ever with our AEG. Many thanks for a great cooker.",Approved
Got fed up breaking normal vacuums and how cumbersome it was to do the stairs. Saw a different model and was tempted but concerned that it might not be powerful enough. Plumpt for the AEG as got it at an excellent price. Cleaning is now easy and has done everything asked of it. My only point of note I would make to the designer is . If you can find a way to empty and clean filter without touching the dirt it would be perfect.,Approved
"Nice and roomy, had another brand the same dimensions but this is larger inside. Once you get used to the controls it is a lot more convenient. I had to keep buying knobs for my other one.",Approved
Using it for last 2 weeks and it's all good so far.,Approved
Easy to use love that the door opens wide easy to override the long programmes to just over an hour it's a quiet spin so very happy with it would recommend,Approved
"Was recommended this machine by the Guy in Currys, and am so glad we took his advise. 
Although it wasn't the cheapest machine in the shop by a long way, sometime it pays to spend a little more and get a quality machine still built in the UK. 
There are plenty of different settings, although I tend to use just of few of them. 
Most people would be put off by the wash times on these new machines, I know I was, but with AEG it weighs the load and adjusts the time accordingly. Most of my loads are done in just over an hour. If you want to make sure it's done quicker you have the option of pressing the time saver button - twice, which will reduce the time by approximately a 1/3 each press.
If you have a couple of garments to wash, these can be done on a 20 minute cycle and come out just as fresh as a longer cycle. 
The added bonus with this machine is its steam facility. It's great used on bedding as when they are subsequently line dried there's hardly a crease in sight, even on 100% cotton sheets!! However it does leave the washing wetter, so it will take longer to dry in a tumble dryer. I have steamed my towels and then given them a further spin only cycle so they are easier to dry but this does crease things up a bit more. 
The size of the drum is another added bonus with this machine, although I never fill it to capacity as I prefer smaller loads ensuring less creasing. 
This machine replaced my old faithful Hotpoint which had been going for nearly 15 years with just a couple of repair jobs. I hope this one lasts as long! 
I must say though, that I noticed a big difference in how clean my washing smelt and looked with this new machine so maybe I should have switched sooner. I am sure this one is much more eco friendly too and will save me money on my electric bill. 
All in all, a great BIG thumbs up for this machine. And it looks good too!!!",Rejected
Love it seems like I'm doing half the washing I was doing because of the large 9kg wash .,Approved
"Good value for money latest technology easy to use 
Easy to control with smart phone and much more I am recommend this product thank you",Approved
"My wife is not happy with the washer. it is not a patch on the Miele it replaced,
She finds the buttons/screen controls very hit and miss, also it creases the washing more.
Disappointed.",Approved
"We are Very very pleased so far with this washing machine, with its massive drum and huge door it’s saves us time and effort. We can wash so much more in just one wash compared to my old machine.",Approved
Lovely quiet machine with a huge drum capacity. Only downside would be the quite long wash time but there is a time save function if necessary,Approved
The machine is easy to programme. Has loads of flexibilty on options for temperature and spin speed. Large capacity. Can be opened as soon as its finished. Has two time saving options. Weighs the washing to save water. Very pleased.,Approved
A great looking appliance that sets off my kitchen beautifully,Approved
Excellent machine. Easy to use and very efficient washing. I love my new washing machine.,Approved
"Excellent product, large variety of programmes to suit every need. Very quite operation. Simple to understand",Approved
Runs very quiet- much quieter than my kettle ha ha! Gets the clothes cleaner than my previous washer without the need to wash again. Very good all round.,Approved
We were looking at dual fuel cookers but the sales assistant suggested we consider an induction as cleaner and as quick as gas hob and quicker than electric oven. She did a demo which convinced us. We looked at the cookers available but AEG won on features and style. More expensive but we just waited until there was a good deal on. So far so good. The only thing I have noticed is I have to have the oven temperature a bit higher than I would have thought and suggested.,Approved
"Quiet running with a, wide variety of programmes. End of programme alert is too quiet and door unlock takes a while after the end of a drying cycle. Only minor niggles though.",Approved
"dust container is too small
item is very light, great for small areas",Approved
"I am not very good with technology, and when my partner got this cooker i did panic a bit but after a couple of days it was like i had the cooker for years i love it.",Approved
This has proven to be an absolute excellent buy. Could not have done better.,Approved
"Large selection of oven settings, and top oven of a good size meaning lower oven is required less.",Approved
I bought this to replace another Zanussi that I'd had for over 11 years. I chose this model ZWF71443W because it had the LED display that shows how much time is left in the cycle and also an adjustable delay feature to benefit using Economy 7 discount hours. The price was affordable and I really like the Zanussi brand - also have a fridge by them.,Approved
"unfortunately , and I don't no why , but I could not get the £50 back?programs",Approved
"This is the first time I have ever had an electric cooker, from a child I only ever cooked on gas, always thought electric were expensive to run as they used to take so long to warm up.
How wrong was I this cooker heats up really quickly, seems to cook a lot quicker than gas. Cooker also has a whole host of features a lot of which I still have to try. Really pleased that to date I haven't yet burnt anything. So if you haven't tried an electric cooker before, go on try an AEG one they are great",Approved
"would normaly cook on 180c on old cooker, seem to take much longer and at higher temp",Approved
"Unable to increase default spin speed.
Timing fuction, for delayed start - only modifies duration of programme selected.",Approved
"Efficient, easy to use, features steam clean very useful .",Approved
Replaced another AEG double fit-under oven. Good design and easy to operate. Only niggle is the sound of the timer is so low it is inaudible if you are not near the cooker.,Approved
"Wanted a 1600 spin, clothes almost dry. Great control of washes , loads and temperatures. Very pleased .Highly recommended.",Approved
"We have not had AEG machines before and decided to try them. It has a large capacity and a high spin speed with features that cover everything we require to wash. The touch buttons take a bit of getting used too as they don't always act as you want them to. The wash quality seems better than other brands we have had. It was an expensive machine but in my opium was worth the extra outlay, the machine is covered by a free five year manufactures warranty also. So far it has performed well and we are pleased with the machine.",Approved
So far this is a very good washing machine. Spins clothes really well so little drying required. I would like there to be a ‘mixed fabrics coloureds’ setting as that is what I seem to do most of but I just wash them on the ‘Synthetics’ and it seems ok. I don’t know yet about longevity but I think it is a good machine for the price.,Approved
"Having only every purchased AEG washing machines for the last 20 years (this is only our third machine) this is a definite upgrade. Great capacity, quick and effective washing and seemingly much quieter. Great product would recommend.",Approved
"This cooker is clean looking because of its large viewing windows in both ovens and because it has no obtrusive knobs. Due to its features and the fact that it does not have knobs it is easy and a pleasure to clean.
The touch controls are perfectly positioned and very precise. All of its electronic controls are easy to use and extremely visible. 
Set temperatures are accurate and food is cocked perfectly. Certainly an oven that I would recommend.",Approved
"A real ""Tardis"" of a fridge with so much room inside. Easy to clean and energy efficient - who could ask for more?",Approved
"Sleek modern and beautiful looking, this cooker has slide controls , no knobs to get dirty, different sized rings to fit all your pans.
The fan oven cooks through food evenly.
Easy to clean bottom and self cleaning sides.
I just love it so!!!",Approved
This washer dryer cleans well and is particularly quiet. It looks good. The digital display including time left is useful. The quick wash at 20 mins is handy too.,Approved
"This washer drier has many very good features, although some of them are rather more difficult to access than others and the instruction manual is not always as helpful as it might be. In particular, the ability to shorten the washing time is not quite clear, although once accessed it is very useful. There are three reservations that I have about the product: 1) the drawer for the washing liquid/powder is rather flimsy and is also difficult to open and close; 2) there is no facility to stop the wool/handwash program without spinning, which is required by some garments in this category; 3) the start button and the buttons to alter the timings/temperature/spin speed do not always react when pressed and then skip through the options bypassing the one required. Despite this, I would recommend the machine as the results are good and the features that are there are extensive.",Approved
"Great quality product, well built and easy to use, very efficient and economical",Approved
"At last a washing machine that weighs the washing load and changes the program cycle-time to suit. The resulting time displayed is often much shorter than expected, a vast improvement on previous fixed cycle times. 
The controls are easy to use and the display shows all of the essential information, including the handy count-down-timer.
The addition of the 'quick wash' button is also a handy feature, for clothes that are lightly soiled, as is the 'steam function' to freshen clothes only. 
The machine is extremely quiet during all cycles (wash, spin and dry) and when finished the washing comes out as expected, clean and fresh.",Approved
"Took a little time to get used to the simplicity of the program controls but soon learned to trust the machine and let it get on with the job. This it does very well indeed. The machine is exceptionally quiet, very suitable for a through kitchen diner and very compact in depth making it fit under worktops without protruding out into the kitchen. Highly recommended!",Approved
"It washes well, but most programmes take hours! It is very quiet. I don’t like the tinted glass as it makes it difficult to keep an eye on the washing.",Approved
"Was reluctant to move on from our 23 year old aeg oven as it hadnt let us down once.The only failing was a single control knob which couldnt be replaced.Naturally we bought another aeg , bit complex to start with but after a couple of weeks use proving superb, hope this one lasts 23 years !!",Approved
"It's only been three weeks of use. Have had the supplier back to adjust the feet as the machine was unstable when spinning despite it appearing level when installed. Found controls easy to use as they were similar to my previous machine. The buttons are quite sensitive so have to watch the options are set right. This is my first washer/dryer so can't compare to other washer/dryers, but labour saving not having to pull out tumble drier and vent to outside. Overall I am very pleased with it.",Approved
"Very easy to control, really like the left hand multi zone. So much easier to use than our previous halogen hob.",Approved
Lovely and easy to use. Does everything I need. No probs,Approved
"We bought all AEG appliances for our newly designed kitchen. Cannot fault any of them.

The hob is easy to control and very sleek, looks beautiful.",Approved
"I love that I can put a wash and dry on as long as load is not too large and that time is calculated on the characteristics of each load. You have to accept that a wash and dry will take time but if you haven't space for 2 separate machines that's the compromise. I also love that you can set the level of dryness you want and it works it out rather than having to guess, check and reset.",Approved
"I went against all the advise I was given of combined washer/dryers not being great. Maybe everyone was using them wrong, they can’t all be bad?

This proves them all wrong, wash and drys great.

Steam and 1 hour wash/dry cycles are excellent features.

If you want convenience, buy it.",Approved
"This is a really nice looking chimney hood that seems effective; strong lights, which is handy, 4 settings for extractions - I tend to use only the first 2-3 as the last is extremely loud. Overall I am happy with it so far.",Approved
"Fan speed is great, clears steam and leaves air fresh",Approved
"Good to use, just push three button's and the machine is away.",Approved
I have found the washer so easy to operate with all the multi functions and economical to use.,Approved
"The machine seems to wash well when used on Delicate s & Synthetics, but will only spin at 1200 rpm to get the full 1400 spin speed it is necessary to use the Cotton Cycle which takes over 2 hours to complete, a long time if waiting for the cycle to finish.",Approved
"Good quality freezer, love that the drawers are on rollers, nice touch with a strong interior light. The finish is very good",Approved
"After only 5 months of light use, brought for doing the stairs mainly only 2 rooms with carpets, this vacuum no longer sucks, I have cleared all filers and waste but no improvement, I can't return as I don't have the receipt, this was a total waste of money.",Approved
"The original product had to be returned due to a very noisy evaporator fan (they think).
This new one however is very quiet and is running perfectly, lovely design. This product replaces my similar old model of AEG Freezer that was 14 years old and the motor was going so very pleased now.",Approved
"Very pleased, great coffee, what more can anyone want for a coffee machine",Approved
"So good I cant stop using it! Light easy to use. I thought the lights were a bit unnecessary until I first used it now I want lights on the hand held bit!! Just so easy to use, every time I pass it I have to whip it off its stand to have another go!!!

WELL DONE AEG",Approved
"We are really pleased with our new hob, it took a bit of getting used to as the heat is almost instantaneous, it has coped with every thing we have cooked on it so far.",Approved
"The Grill is very hot it would be nice to be able to adjust the heat,to keep moving the shelf down is not ideal especially as the liners are so noisy. It would be good if the numbers on the dials were a bit larger the size of the oven numbers is better...The large grill is excellent.",Approved
This is our first AEG washing machine having always had Bosch and what a difference it is to our old machine. The controls are very clear and easy to use. It is very quiet when washing and spinning and the range of wash cycles are excellent. We have yet to try a number of them including the steam option but if they work as well as the ones we have tried so far they will be great.,Approved
"This machine has a front larger than others we were not made aware of this before buying
it sticks out about 6"" and means that a cupboard door will not open fully now.",Approved
The keep warm button has never worked on my kettle,Approved
Great product which can be used in many ways. Suitable for use and can almost be personalised! Even options available that I doubt I will ever need!,Approved
All the features names in the specs and retail outlet websites live up to their name. The quality of washes is good. the dryer appears good too though not had a chance to use it frequently with the great outdoor weather at the moment (prefer natural drying). Only reason for not giving 5 Star rating is the fact that the shortest cycle is 60mins and that too for a small load - not a huge issue. No regrets in the purchase.,Approved
Would have given 5 stars if oven came with set of gliders to stabilise oven shelf. I ordered this seperately. Great accessory but expensive,Approved
"Had it for a week, and it’s been great. Quieter than most washing machines I’ve used. Its good all round. Still not used many functions, so many!! Upto now I will give it 10/10",Approved
It replaced my previous AEG washer dryer which was also loved. There are multiple programmes which can be customised within reason. However the one thing I miss greatly is the 20 min 3kg cycle. This was the most used programme of my previous AEG machine and now not included on this model.,Approved
"So much colder than the old appliances, also quieter and use less electricity",Approved
"This is amazing, I think you should buy this. This is, like, the best thing I have ever purchased. Do eeeeeet.",Approved

The drop drawer fronts at the top mean we really do use all the space efficiently. There is room to fill with home cooked meals in portions to ensure money saving options for lunch or eating alone. Great economy rating too.,Approved
This product fits well as an under unit fridge/ freezer. Perfect for what we needed. Very spacious!,Approved
"It picks up a lot of dirt and fluff and I have some coir carpets it picked up more than I thought was there so it must be cleaning deeply.
Main drawbacks are: short power lead, short hose and metal tubes which are heavier than plastic if you want to vacuum ceiling or walls (I do because we have a lot of wooden beams that spiders like to make webs in). The short power lead is a problem in an old house like ours where there aren't many power sockets.",Approved
I use this product both for the car and the home. Most suitable for both.,Approved
"purchase from currys 18/10 cordless hoover model AG3011 only had 2 months it is no longer working ,store in Sevenoaks way said it would be a repair job this is discusting for a 2 month old product various attempt to find out how long I will be with out no one seems to know what there doing I would not at this stage recommend any of your products to any one is this is what happens after 2 months",Rejected
We have been coming to the AEG stand for 5 years we love it! No prizes this year :(,Approved
This was the only frost free integrated freezer we could find but the size and quality are very obvious and perfect for our purpose.,Approved
Thanks for letting me testing ! Excellent easy to use and economical,Rejected
Great machine but not as good as separate washer and dryer. Sadly I had to sell my wonderful AEG dryer to make room for a full size dishwasher. Don't know if it's my imagination but laundry seems cleaner. Does tend to crease a bit more than my old Hotpoint but with a steam generator iron it's not too much of a problem. A good compromise.,Approved
"The others are hobs this is magic ,the best thing we,ve bought in a long time, its got everything , really happy with it",Approved
I have been impressed with both of the ovens and their versatility. The only disappointment has been the user manual which does not give enough information on how the various settings work.,Approved
"pleased with every feature, could not have purchased a better machine",Approved
"I did a lot of research to find the most appropriate machine for my needs. I am so pleased with my choice, this machine is great. I love the fact you can reduce washing times as so many other machines have such long programmes. I would recommend this machine to anyone.",Approved
"So quiet, great range of programs but so simple to use.",Approved
A very practical kettle. Easy to keep clean and has one of the best pouring spouts I have ever had on a kettle. No drips. Easy to fill. Digital temperature great addition. Overall a super kettle. Best one I have purchased and I have got through a few over the years !!!!!!,Approved
We have had the dishwasher operating for a month now. It is very simple to operate and cleans very well. There is room for improvement with the glass racks as larger glasses struggle to stand up.,Approved
"We have been absolutely delighted with this dishwasher, though only 3 settings, we have actually found the simplicity refreshing and everything comes out of the dishwasher sparkling and clean. It is quiet, packs easily and fits a lot in, overall just really happy with it.",Approved
Does what it says on the tin and works well in Spain although not available on the Spanish market.,Rejected
The dishwasher is easy to use and a 30 min wash cycle is awesome,Approved
Hob so easy to use but very susceptible to glass breaking around the edge. This is our second hob replacing one that was badly cracked due to an empty rapeseed oil bottle being knocked over. Please think about reinforcing edges. Otherwise the hob is so easy to use and so efficient,Approved
"Cooks to perfection. Had great results. Quiet and easy to keep clean. 
Only negative is the control dial! For some reason the different functions and temperatures are on the actual dial making it very difficult to read when the oven is fitted at eye level. Definite design fault!",Approved
I was dubious about changing from a gas job but was pleasantly surprised by this job. It looks great is far easier to clean than gas and is just as controllable. The bonus is the speed it brings water to the boil. Amazing,Approved
Fab machine allthough the battery has packed up but excellent customer services has sorted it out,Approved
"Great cleaner on laminate flooring, excellent for those with mobility issues as is light and stands upright unsupported, very easy to maneuver.",Approved

"I love my Ergorapido. It's easy to use and quick to put away so I haven't used my big Hoover as often anymore. The detachable dust buster is great on my stairs, sofa, window sills and blinds. I don't use the front headlights as much as I thought I would but they are still a nice feature, especially when I use the ergorapido on my kitchen floor as it's black. Run time is good and just enough battery life for what I use it for.",Approved
"Bought this to replace our old AEG washing machine which had lasted for about 6-7 years despite the demands of a family of 6. This is well made, washes well and fits lots of washing in. Plus the 5 year guarantee.",Approved
Makes cleaning the house so easy. Very good vacuum cleaner Sad that the nozzle and brush missing from the packet but AEG sorting that out,Approved
Fantastic and stylish double oven. Easy to operate but does everything you need it to and does it well. Delighted with this produxt,Approved
This is a replacement for a very old induction hob and am delighted to see how many new functions there are. Easy to use and even easier to clean. Would never have a range again!,Approved
"Our first one lasted a year then would not pump water. The replacement leaked water from inside the casing from day 2, the third one leaked water from inside the casing on day 1. We chose another colour thinking it was a batch production problem and its still going well, fingers crossed",Approved
Only negative point is that the FAN button must be precise on the number otherwise the FAN does not work. So sometimes you have to wiggle the button,Approved
"I love the kettle, it gets me a right temperature for my green tea and Woolong tea as well. The best ever!",Approved
very good all round easy to work and silent to use . A very good buy. Our previous AEG lasted 25 years . that says it all I think,Approved
Takes so long to complete a cycle the day has gone before the washings out.After several weeks use I am concerned that my clothes look battered and have begged my husband to replace it ASAP.,Approved
Has good suction power but not good manoeuvrability.,Approved
Purchasers need to be advised as to how noisy it is,Approved
"this hob is very good, it has great control over each of the five rings, and is so easy to clean, i would highly recommend it.",Approved
Just what we needed in the heat wave great machine and so easy to use cooled down room from as soon as being plugged in you could feel the difference. A bit expensive but you get what you pay for and AEG you can’t go wrong.,Approved
Overall the double oven is a useful asset to our kitchen there are many useful operating options and the handbook instructions are usefull.The Grill in the top oven isn't very good for making toast and we thought there may be a problem with it until we found the separate information supplied specific to this grill.,Approved
This is my second AGE machine and I love it!!!! Dave,Approved
I have already reviewed this larder fridge and AEG in their wisdom sent me an email stating my review was not up to AEG's standard consequently the review was rejected and I was not entered into the draw. AEG asked for a review and I provided one. Obviously AEG appear to only allow certain reviews to be posted. And I did not receive a free product. Poor do AEG!.............Well post this one!,Rejected
"Compliments my AEG oven perfectly, modern cleaning design, quickly warm up",Approved
the extractor fan is very noisey at low speed and even worse at high speed.,Approved
"Extremely quiet machine, Cleans clothes wonderfully. Wash times are a little long  but I think its because its washing the clothes properly. Would highly recommend.",Approved
Thanks for letting me testing ! it was fab and efficient. so quick,Rejected
The blender was awesome and much more convenient than traditional ones.,Approved
This product looks great. However it's 69 decibels according to some seller websites. The level of uncomfortable loudness is 70db. I wasn't advised to consider noise by the people who sold this item. My wife and I cant be in the room when it's running due to the noise. Really consider this aspect before you buy.,Approved
Simple to operate and a real sleek design make this the perfect plate warmer. It can also slow cook food for that extra tender beef we all love. Highly recommended.,Approved
"Very effective and efficient . Very stylish and compliments the AEG HOB and Oven .
When on max power it is a little on the noisy side. however at setting one and 2 it does the job brilliantly",Approved
Really pleased with our new dishwasher. By far the best we have had.,Approved
I think this product is amazing really easy to use would recommend it to anyone. And all the other products.,Approved
The auto load weighing and steam features make this an advanced eco friendly machine. It also washes extremely well and so far has dealt with all the dirt and stains.,Approved
"I bought this product recently and I don't regret.
It works fine and the price is ok. Nice design too.",Approved
Just replaced very old AEG washing machine which I bought 16 years ago from new lasted a very long time constantly being run 2 to 3 times a day everyday so when it started playing up we new we had to buy another AEG washing machine this one is very easy to use . Told next door neighbor he went out and bought the same machine,Approved
"Blends very well, easy to clean and use. Bottles very good quality.",Approved
Excellent product design really easy to cook microwave is pretty good to recommend it to everyone,Approved
"Impossible to navigate the website, too long is spent holding on call with multiple options to get through to the correct team.",Rejected
"Lots of programmes for every type of wash, quiet, economical and an excellent wash. The 20min wash is so handy for sportswear. This is my 2nd AEG and replaces my 11year old one which never went wrong and has been given to a family member.",Approved
Had a great tool me using all the equipment and cooking great food. Look forward to coming back next year to taste of London.,Approved
"Our old washer was nearly 10 years old and I am over the moon with all the fab features in this machine. Best bits being you can wash dry clean clothes (I know how good is that!), steam and control the length of the cycle dependant on load size. It's super quiet even when on full spin and is great to look at too. Genuinely excited to have this model and am going to enjoy playing around with all the features.",Approved
"Replacement for another inbuilt machine. So far, this machine seems to be quieter than the one it replaced with less vibration when spinning. We like the Refresh Cycle for slightly soiled clothes.",Approved
Same external size as my old Hotpoint but huge internal dimensions. The fridge has adjustable 1/2 shelves and extra head room for bottles and cans which is superb. The build quality is first class and it is extremely quiet. The audible and visual alarms are ideal in letting you know you have had the door open for too long. The extra cool buttons for both fridge and freezer when adding fresh food cool the food super fast. All in all a super build - cost wise you only get what you pay for. Will definitely be looking at more AEG kitchen appliances.,Approved
"Needed a combined Washer-Dryer & after much surveying, this AEG came out well in surveys..if a tad expensive. Apart from a few initial strange error lights ...maybe ""finger trouble"" on my part?...it seems to be working well., Thank You.",Approved
The power feature of the hob is a very useful addition. Makes cooking much quicker,Approved
We went with aeg as our last machine lasted over 15 years and spending a little more saved us money before. It has enough settings for our needs and the drum is a good size for all our washing.,Approved
"I was looking for a new washing machine went to John Lewis & Partners ,was given a demonstration explained all the programs the machine did was very impressed, especially the steam program ideal for linen and silk also the larger opening on the machine, it’s excellent that you can adjust the temperature and spin speed on the programs. Extremely pleased with my purchase.",Approved
"It's best feature is the quick programme option in particular if your clothes are not heavily soiled. Like most washing machine programmes a normal wash seem to take forever so this option cuts back on usage time.
So far I have only used 5 of the settings just to try them out , but generally I seem to use the Synthetic programme which covers most garments, and the cotten programme for sheets and towels.",Approved
Machine is only a few weeks old but initial reaction is positive & worth the outlay.,Approved
"Had Dysons all my life but this little machine is every match for them and much better value..Easy to us with very helpful lighting on the front it is a joy to use...two small issues , one I find putting the machine back on the charging stand quite awkward and two the dirt holder doesn't,t always click back on easily after emptying...In saying this they are the only two issues I,ve had otherwise it,s a joy to use and the battery lasts for a considerable length of time, I got the whole house done and there was still a small amount left , we live in a 3bed Dorma Bungalow ..Suction is excellent and I feel every bit as good as Dyson we have dogs , need I say more ! If it had attachments it would be perfect ...A good buy ..",Approved
"The cooker is elegant, well made and easy to operate. However, one small drawback is that the function symbols do not appear to be illuminated and in poor light they can only be seen with difficulty.",Approved
"Everything works perfectly. Especially love speed mode 30 min wash.
However lack of combined mode with washing and drying in one cycle. You'll have to select new setting to start drying. My old machine had this mode",Approved
"Very quite, auto washing weight/time selection, good features and very good washing results.",Approved
Great fridge lots of useable space. Door space well thought out.,Approved
"It took a while to work out which oven setting would be beat but now we seem to have it. It heats up quickly and cooks evenly, looks great too",Approved
Selected this machine against Siemens and Miele as it had the functions and load capacity we were looking for along with excellent ECO credentials at a competitive price.,Approved
Loved it - ALWAYS A FAN OF AEG. IT'S ALL I BUY. EVEN HAVE A AEG BADGE. LOOKING FORWARD TO MAKING SOME SMOOTHIES!,Approved
This oven has encouraged my son to start cooking the built in recipes are great and easy to try,Approved

this is a fantastic product. i would buy it again. you should too.,Approved
"The machine is great, the only thing that bothers me is that I cannot find a way to complete a wool run without spinning and then later add spinning at low speed, it only allows 1400, which is too fast.",Approved
What a great washing machine. So easy to use. I love the look and feel of it and the clothes are virtually crease free.,Approved
"This is my first electric cooker after many years of cooking with gas, and I am wondering why I didn't do it sooner.
I was drawn to the touch panel controls and they make using the hob and oven very easy to use, once that is you work out what they all mean. The instruction book though packed with information misses out on the basics, and I learnt more by trial and error.
The main oven is fantastic, very spacious for a standard width cooker and the smaller top oven is perfect for smaller quantities.
On the whole I would recommend this appliance wholeheartedly!",Approved
The w/machine is built to a high standard and made to last.,Approved
"we have been using the machine for about a month with no problems , it washes and spins very smoothly with very little noise",Approved
The drawers set this freezer apart - they make it very easy to access the frozen food. And the internal light is surprisingly helpful.,Approved
This is an excellent washer dryer that takes good care of all your fabric types.,Approved
Our first steam oven so I can't compare with any other steam oven but I am happy with the results we're getting with it. The racks can be taken out really easily which helps for cleaning.,Rejected
Purchased this as our first coffee machine. We wanted milk frother to be able to do hot chocolate. It cleans in the dishwasher. Perfect,Approved
"We find the coffee machine a really useful appliance. Easy to operate and delicious coffee, from a very wide range of 'flavours'.",Approved
"I researched cookers for some time online. The cooker came up tops on all the features I was looking for. (Dual fuel, double oven, cast iron supports and glass lid.) I like the angled instruments panel, like Zanussi has. The knobs look a bit plastic for such a smart cooker, but are flush and clean and work well. I like the smart knobs of Smeg and Rangemaster classic that I have used in the past, but they did get bumped easily and hooked on clothing. Maybe AEG would consider aluminium knobs in the same shape as their current ones for a more premium look and feel? Because it is one part of the cooker that you touch and feel every time you use it, it is a key area to invest in user enjoyment and reinforce the perception of quality. The inset pan supports are different to what I am used to, but having used them, all spills pool inside the 'valley' and pots are extra secure on top and will not slip to the side. The five year warranty gave me extra peace of mind. I purchased online with Currys and bought the extra service plan for added peace of mind. AEG has very good write ups with regard to quality and I look forward to years of hassle free enjoyment of the cooker. I have had the cooker for two weeks and have had no trouble getting to grips with using the stove or ovens. My aunt bought the same cooker last year, also after a long online search, but opted for the electric top whereas I prefer a gas top. We only realised that we had the same cooker after I had bought mine and had a chuckle over it. The wok hob is really hot which I like. The ovens are really efficient and cook quickly, I have had to adjust to shorter times for baking etc to what I am used to. Cleaning the top is as expected for a gas top. I have cooked for years on gas, with top end brands like Smeg and AEG, this cooker does not disappoint!",Approved
We had a chance to use the AUG induction hob and watch the steam oven in action! I was a fantastic experience and would definitely consider getting one for my new kitchen.,Approved
"This machine is not cheap. However, build quality is first class, spin is quiet, and perfect for the larger family who use a washing machine several times a day.",Approved
"I like all the different programs, it’s easy to keep clean and it weighs the washing so doesn’t take long to go through a cycle",Approved

"Brilliant piece of equipment, we have a stair lift and before we had a fiddly job of getting round the framework, but no problem now with the hose attachment .would recommend it every time",Approved
"When using the hose it is difficult to manage when you are right-handed: as the hose is on the left-hand side of the machine when using it.. It gets better with practice. Need to ensure that any loose dirt is in front of you and not behind: as the exhaust from the machine will blow it everywhere. In general, a good purchase as it does what I needed it for: especially in the car",Approved
"I love my AEG dishwasher. My glasses have never been so shiny. It cleans everything, including pots and pans extremely well even on the 30 minute cycle. It's quiet even when not on 'silent' mode. But, best of all, everything comes out completely dry. I didn't think dishwashers like this existed and am grateful to John Lewis reviewers who all raved about it and gave it a unanimous 5 stars.",Approved
"I recently bought this machine because my previous washers were all Breaking down at 3 - 4 years , I am really please with this machine it washes well and clothes come out looking clean , it quiet and you can wash to suit your requirements, I also bought the Tumble drier and also this is very good totally recommend both these machines",Approved
oven bakes very eavenly and water reservoir is a useful addition,Approved
"I find this hoover to be good for cleaning the stairs and car. It is well made and not to heavy, some reviews state that it's heavy and not as powerful as it is made out to be. I personally can't really fault it, however if it were a bit more powerful it would be better for picking up dog hairs. Although I do have 5 dogs so I suppose that it is doing what it is meant to do. Overall I am very happy with my purchase plus it comes with a 2 year guarantee, a very good purchase for the price.",Approved
"I really don't understand the other review giving this freezer 5 stars!

The instructions are terrible and written in poor English.

The alternative fixing holes for the door hinges were not tapped making swapping the door around a very long chore.

You actually have to drill into the freezer door to attach your kitchen door to it. There are no markings or templates showing where the holes should be made.

It is not quiet at all!",Approved
Great looks and features. Most importantly make brilliant toast. Recommend to all.,Approved
"Very smart, high quality & very quiet. Excellent results & features although top tray loading not the most ergonomic(took a long time to come up with workable solution). It replaced a Bosch, that was much more intuitive.",Approved
"This washing machine is great. The washing comes out clean on each cycle. There are plenty of programme options. Very quiet on washing and spin. Time save feature fantastic and because it shows the kilos on the programme it means younger members of the family have not tried to crame everything into one wash.
I would highly recommend this machine.",Approved
"A great size full height freezer with plenty of room.

However I find the plastic drawers and fronts quite brittle and flimsy, I know someone in the house will break them over time and that replacements will be very expensive.",Approved
Thanks for letting me testing ! Efficient and easy to use,Rejected
Great little toaster that looks amazing in any kitchen . Love the shiny red colour . Easy to use and toasts beautifully . Only downside is that the slots are rather small so have to cut the majority of slices in half to toast or turn upside down to toast the upper side . Overall love it .,Approved
"Purchased for me as a gift. Makes nice coffee but leaks like a sieve. As it was a gift unfortunately don’t have a receipt. Despite registering product, customer services very evasive. Pretty good chance this will end up in the bin soon. Wish I had kept my Tassimo",Approved
Quietly efficient with excellent features and superb spin abilities.,Approved
The process was quick and easy. The dessert is definitely one to remember. Very delicious!,Approved
Cutlery tray is a nuisance! Fouls with glasses on tray below. Quality feels quite lightweight compared to my previous dishwasher which was a Miele. Don't like where the on/off switch is positioned. Air dry is a good idea as are the internal lights. Wouldn't buy another.,Approved
"Easy to use, safe quick efficient and sleek looking",Approved
"A good looking machine with a plethora of features. However had (and still do) have issues with the heat inverter / drying cycle not working etc. 

Not good value for money considering the cost of the machine!",Approved
"This is a very stylish toaster, which enhances the look of any kitchen, and it has all the features you could want. However, it is not deep enough to take a standard size piece of bread, meaning a third of the slice remains completely untoasted. This seems to me to be an extraordinary oversight by a prestigious brand such as AEG. If the product description clearly said 'only for use with small loaves of bread', that would have made it clear to any prospective buyer. As it is, we are left with a toaster that only toasts half the bread - i.e. a toaster which is pretty well useless. What a shame! Quality, however, is up to the usual AEG standards.",Approved
"THIS COOKER IS EASY TO KEEP CLEAN. I LIKE THE TIMERS ON THE HOB. THE OVENS MAINTAIN A STABLE TEMP FOR A LONG TIME ONCE THE TEMP HAS BEEN REACHED, THIS MUST AID ECONOMY OF USE. HOW TO OPERATE THE GRILL I FOUND CONFUSING AND THE HANDBOOK DIDNT HELP BUT WE GOT TO UNDERSTAND IT AFTER ASHORT WHILE. STILL GETTING USED TO GRILLING WITH THE DOOR SHUT.OVERALL A EXCELLENT COOKER, VERY WELL BUILT AND LOOKS GOOD IN MY NEW KITCHEN. TOP PRODUCT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.

All parts of the machine that need cleaning or emptying are easily removed as is the water tank.
I like it so much I went back and thanked the demonstrator at John Lewis.",Rejected
Bringing toasting up to date. Reliable degree of toasting every time. Most useful is countdown of when ready enabling other tasks to be completed or not. Very pleased,Approved
"The advertised dimension did not include the lid handle. This meant that the storeage space was more than I expected, which was good.
But it was too deep for the place that I had available. I solved the problem by removing the Lid Handle and filling the small screw holes with plastic grommets.",Approved
Had to return the machine as it was faulty at least I hope it was took ages to make coffee and dumped a lot of water in the container under the pod collector,Approved
"Great cooker, easy to use and clean, loads of room for all your cooking and baking needs.",Approved
"Purchased this oven to replace a well known make of dual fuel cooker, I was concerned that I would miss the gas hob having always used gas. It has been a revelation to me, this induction hob is so easy to use, much more responsive than a gas flame, really safe with young grand children around and so easy to keep clean. The main oven cooks very evenly and food does not seem to dry out as much. I have not used the top oven yet, only the grill which is used with the door closed, the results have been good and of course having the door closed is another excellent safety feature, overall an excellent product, certainly one to recommend.",Approved
I used it without problems only once. I’d had the toaster less than a month it blew the fuses every time I used it. Seriously disappointed,Approved

"I never knew I could get so excited over a washing machine. The amount of settings and variables it has to ensure clothing is pristine every time it's washed is just brilliant. Being able to use Eco settings, colour settings and even outdoor settings has made washing a dream and my partner's rugby kit has never been so clean when using the Outdoor/Stains settings!",Approved
The manual for all the cooking times is very useful with the features provided. the results are inline with this times,Approved
This machine replaced our previous aeg which lasted 13 years of hard graft washing for a family of 6. I have no reason to doubt that this current machine won't perform and last as well as our old one,Approved
The washing machine is quiet and very effective and it is easy to programme. I would certainly recommend this model to a friend.,Approved
"Visually its a cracking looking machine, with a minimalistic user interface, just a dial and two buttons and a touchscreen that making choosing the cycle you need super easy and totally customisable.  The loading Door is lovely and big so it makes loading into the ‘massive' 9KG drum really easy. The soap draw is nicely layed out with easy access to the salt draw that softens the water depending on what type of hardness you have. Included is litmus test so you can be really accurate with the PH values meaning you don’t waste salt. 
 
I have to be honest I was sceptical as to the WiFi function, and didn’t really see the point – but I’m a convert! Its so easy to set the function straight from your phone, throw the washing, powder/liquid and conditioner in and tap start! 
It will also send you reminder that your washings done which is handy as it runs pretty much silently through all the functions even the 1600rpm spin cycle.  
 
Id also recommend the app for discovering how to care for your laundry including how to deal with pretty much any type of stain you might encounter.
 
With having such a huge capacity I’m finding I can do a whole weeks washing in two loads and some washes don’t need the works either as it seems to do a great job even on the 20 minute cycle. I love the powder premix function meaning the water is washing from the get go and not getting stuck as grains in my clothes. It’s even removed marks on my ski gear that I could never shift before.
 
Like most men I’m allergic to ironing – but with this its made my life so much easier as it doesn’t seem to crease my cloths as much (again possibly down to the size of the drum). 
 
Overall its a cracking washing machine, that goes way beyond any machine I’ve owned in the past and should wash my garments better while saving me money due to it being A+++ rated. Very impressed.",Approved
"Runs very quietly, no more defrosting . What more could I want!",Approved
"No knobs. High tech cooker works great. Cooks a treat and easy to use. Sleek bit of t would look great in any kitchen. Had it a couple of years and still Looks like new on the outside, not clean inside though.",Approved
Induction hobs and oven heats up quickly and hobs as responsive as gas,Approved
"I bought the cooker after reading the Which review - and my experience to date reflects the test results.

Stable, consistent results obtained using either oven. Flexible cooking with the many cooking modes, especially the main oven. 

The cooker has a quality feel to it and nice tactile controls.

I would recommend the product from a quality manufacturer",Approved
High quality product. Drying should take less time. Really silent.,Approved
quite machine well designed machine with superb technology providing quality results,Approved
I bought this freezer to store produce from my garden and allottment. The shelves are well spaced with individual doors/flaps to reduce loss of operating temperature when the main door is opened. It was competitively priced and operates efficiently.,Approved
"Really pleased with this choice, a quality machine, easy to use, extremely quiet and looks great",Approved
A fantastic washing machine that operates silently!,Approved
"This machine is well worth the money, it runs exceedingly smoothly, and is very quiet. Oh, I forgot, it gets yr clothes very clean",Approved
"This is the first washer/dryer I've had. I've always usually had separate ones. But wanted to free up some space, so decided to give a combined one a try. At first I was sceptical as to if it would perform as well. I've since had it about 2 weeks now and I must admit I am very happy with this appliance. It's easy to use and very quiet in when on a spin or drying. Good sized drum for our medium sized family it's used almost on a daily basis.
 The only downfall I can think of is the child lock feature can be temperamental to activate/deactivate apart from that I'm really impressed.",Approved
My previous dish washer was not designed to take long stemmed wine glasses so the glasses did not sparkle as we had to hand wash them. I am so pleased now as this dish washer washes all our glassses to perfection. I would recommend - wash programs are generally very good.,Approved
"Love this machine, it is large has a range of different programs sooo quiet unlike my last machine. Well worth the money. Love the 20min wash very useful for my swim kit.",Approved

"Having cooked on gas for around 50 years we decided to consider induction after our daughter raved about the hob she had recently had installed.
Its different, for sure, very hi-tec and new, with touch controls and digital display BUT, its also fairly easy to operate once one gets used to not seeing a flame or anything else to confirm the power is turned on and up/down.
In fact, its very controllable and very quick to respond to any adjustment of the power level.
The more we use it the easier and better it gets :)
I think we'll keep it :-)",Approved
"Great looking with lots of a space
Freezes well.with no issues
Quiet in operation
Only issue is temperature dial on front - not entirely clear what setting you are pointing at when turning dial - silly issue to have when so.basic and easy to rectify at production.",Approved
"Having cooked on gas for the last 50 years, using the AEG inductive Electric cooker as been a revelation!",Approved
this is our first washer dryer and we have found it to have a great layout with easy to understand controls. it is also very quiet when running even at fast spin speeds.,Approved
The oven is a step up on what we have had before and cooks really well. For a family kitchen I would have thought it could have been a little bigger though.,Approved
Brilliant piece of kit. Easy to use and powerful. Controls are a pleasure with easy touch control,Approved
"Excellent oven, loaded with useful features. Cheaper than equivalent spec ovens from other brands. Everything can be stripped, including the heating element and oven rack supports, to clean the interior. Door can be removed for cleaning, which is a real bonus.

"This is the first induction cooker and we feel that we bought a high quality product, the best desing, looks really nice and smart. It is fnctional, easy to clean, efficient and overall an enjoyable product. There are two issues we would like were different. One is the responsiveness of the touch buttons, sometimes it takes more than one attempt for the button to respond. The other issue is that only one of the two ovens can be used at a time, it is not possible to have the two ovens working simultaneously. However, we are happy with the product overall.",Approved
"Fantastic product,excellent quality,and very easy to use,induction hob is superb and both ovens great,with no lack of space for cooking ..overall would highly recommend,it is well worth spending the extra for the quality of this appliance.",Approved
we have had several machines over the years and this is the best ever quiet multi function operation. the quick 20 min wash produces great results in the very quick wash. we would recommend your products without hesitation. we are now looking to upgrade our cooker to AEG,Approved
"I am very happy with my purchase,the wash is much cleaner especially the whites much whiter it's even removed old blood stains on my shirt which my old washer couldn't remove.The wash features are excellent and very easy to adjust the times if you want a quicker wash.The touch screen works well and I like the pause function if you have forgotten something you can stop and add the item quickly. EXCELLENT PRODUCT.",Approved
"Great machine, looks very modern with the digital screen. Easy open door. Clothes seem to come out less creased too!",Approved
"Freezer drawer appear clumsy and noisy. Ice making box poor, was expecting to be able to plumb water in.
Its ok nothing special",Approved
"This was my first purchase of a portable air conditioning unit, and AEG have not disappointed. It is really a great unit and has provided much needed cooling during the recent heat wave.
The unit is finished to a high standard and is great at cooling a room down and keeping it cool. I love the full automatic setting, which is the one that is used the most. Also, the remote control is very handy and has a LCD display and has a back light. 
I only have one negative, which is the venting hose, which could be a little longer, to make it easier to place against an open window.",Approved
I wish product came with a bit that would section off the window which is left open with the duct to avoid the exhaust air back in,Approved
I bought this washing machine after I bought oven and fridge from AEG. Never been happier. I have tried many other brands in the past when I lived in rent. I can say that AEG is quality.,Approved

"I am really enjoying trying all the functions on this machine, I love the steam function which is excellent for refreshing clothes, The OKO function is good too, the ability to alter spin speeds is very useful, I am still exploring this machine. Overall very pleased with it.",Approved
"Great AEG single oven, quality and size for a single oven is very good. Quality of cooking excellent and with plenty of functions, overall very happy with our purchase. Only problem we found was the instructions could be better and we believe the translation from German should be improved. Sometimes we had to read the same instructions a couple of times to try and make sense of what was written. Apart from this a good quality oven and worth the price.",Approved
"I enjoy using the oven but thought the instructions could be clearer in places, although this could be that its some years since I’ve had to start with a new oven.",Approved

"I bought this dishwasher for its features and great reviews. As this is a fully integrated machine, it had to be built in. The instructions were easy enough for me to do it myself and the whole process was very straightforward. The comfort lift is a super feature which in the end made me buy this particular machine, however, the SuperSilent washing program is what I value the most. Obviously, I only found this out after installing the machine and using this program! I even checked up if it was still running, that's how silent it is! The dishes come out clean and dry, just as they supposed to. All-in-all, this is the best dishwasher I've owned so far.",Approved
We brought this product because of the manufacturer name. Since having it installed we find it cleans very well and so silent ... We would certainly recommend it to our friends,Approved
"Bought from John Lewis in Trafford Centre. Attracted by Looks then reading reviews from Which magazine and awards. We couldn’t find anything we didn’t like. The salesman couldn’t recommend enough the running cost and programmes. The 5 year garentee would give us pease of mind. We have used it for about 3 weeks my wife loves it so quiet and the programmes cover every type washing. The OXO a real winner, the 1600 spin cuts down on drying time. The machine is well made and feels solid up to the job. Would highly recommend",Approved
My Zanussi freezer only lasted 6 weeks before I stopped working and had to be collected by the retailer I bought it from. Not a happy bunny. Lets hope its replacement does better.,Rejected

I have two ovens. They look good in my kitchen. They are simple to use. They cook efficiently. They are easy to clean. I am having quire a love affair with them and would thoroughly recommend them to anyone considering their purchase.,Approved
"I am impressed with this mashing machine , it washes really good and it is very quiet.",Approved
It looks fab in my kitchen and I love there are no knobs to watch out for when leaning over the hob. The P power on the hob boils water FAST but the oven takes longer to cook than my previous fan assisted oven and simmer on the hob has to be at number 7 whereas my Hotpoint was on 5. Generally everything seems to take longer to cook. For twice the price of my induction Hotpoint cooker I expected the AEG to at least be on par with my Hotpoint or even better!,Approved
"I must say I was surprised at this oven, I have used AEG ovens for more years than I care to remember, Bought this one to replace earlier model that I had more or less worn out. It not only looks good, it does its job well and I even have the option of steam bake. All at a very attractive price too. Fitting it was a doddle - old one slid out and new one slid in. Heres to another decade or more of trouble free cooking!",Approved
"This is the best oven I have ever had, so easy to use and control. Although I have not used all the function yet what I have use have been amazing, love the steam function made home made bread this was beautifully soft in the middle with a lovely crust. The cooking of Victoria sponge was brilliant as there was no going flat in place when cooling I left this in the oven to cool after turning off, the even temperature all round the oven is very good, and lighting in the oven is the best I have seen.
Very please with everything about this AEG oven",Approved

"best decision I made purchasing induction hob, had a gas hob for many years, but was upgrading kitchen with new worktop, sink & hob. after reading many good reviews on induction & bearing in mind the safety aspect, I decided to get an AEG model as all my original kitten appliance's were AEG & had serviced us well. easy to set up, simple use, & clean. would not go back to any other type of hob.",Approved
"noisy and wobbly, even with a builders 'spirit level' pinpointing the horizontal, the machine makes an unbearable wobble and frightening noise, often when loaded only more than 65percent full.Sounds like an aircraft taking off when on auto spin. I've read and re read the manual to make sure everything was set up ok, so am very disappointed. The washing cycles take a long time to wash, but at least the cleaning is thorough.",Approved
"I have had the machine a couple of weeks and have only tried a few of the many different programme options. The washing and drying results have been very good so far (have used cotton and wool options so far).
The door opening is very large which is useful when putting things such as duvet covers in the machine but the tinted glass door does look very over-powering in my small kitchen.
The on/off switch and the start switch are a bit stiff and require a bit of pressure to push them.",Approved
Induction failure on day 2 out of box. AEG refuse to change or refund! Overly complex! Lost all confidence in induction hobs.  Going back to gas.,Rejected
"Very pleased with this hob, not only looks good but had right variety of rings for cooking which respond instantly.",Approved
"I've always had gas hobs, but I have to say this is so quick and easy I wish I had changed years ago. I love all the features, especially the quickness of it all if I need it. Easy to clean, its fab!",Approved
Good value for money with 5 year guarantee.My previous cooker was fan oven only [not AEG} and semed to have a mind of its own which decided me to buy multifunction.So far all functions have worked well but thermaflow function could be better explained in user manual.,Approved
"This is the second time I have bought this washing machine (the first was lost in a flood). I almost went for the Meile despite the price but due to the 5 yr versus 2 year guarantee I stuck with the AEG. I was and am still disappointed that I have to set 2 extra rinses in order to get almost all (but not all) of the suds out. I am using the Ariel 3-in-1 pods recommended. I tried tumble drying my towels after 2 extra rinses and they came out stiff as a board - evidence that there was still soap in them, I believe. I no longer use the ""woollens"" cycle because you can't program extra rinses, so I use the synthetics cycle and adjust the temp/spin options then add 2 rinses. It's a shame because this is a great washer in every other way and extremely quiet in use and in spin cycle., It's probably due to the Eco garbage we ar getting lumbered with these days wherein minimum water has to be used to get the AAA rating. I had a similar problem with an Indesit.",Approved
Brilliant machine. Really quiet and smooth. Build quality is excellent and far better than the previous machine,Approved
"This is a quiet machine, not an issue for me but if needed to be in a kitchen you could still hold a conversation. Many programme choices, as yet I have only used a few, super impressed with the wool wash, no more hand washing! Easy to programme.",Approved
"Great machine, has loads of wash options, functionality etc and even dry cleans!! Brilliant buy - great 5 year warranty.",Approved
"The machine is of excellent quality, it performs well and is relatively quiet. It is easy to operate with all of the features that are needed.
The large capacity drum is particularly useful for bulky items not often washed such as duvets, pillows etc. The dying seems to work well for these items too.
The steaming feature is also very useful.
All in all we are delighted with it.",Approved

"This is our first Zanussi washing machine and we are very pleased with it.
There are a good variety of different programmes and the machine is very quiet compared to some washing machines that we have had in the past.
One handy thing about the machine is the time delay which means you can programme the machine to start at your convenience and not end up with washing that could smell,

We are very happy with this purchase so far.",Approved

My last AEG cooker lasted for 22 years. So far this one has been a big disappointment. The thermostat for the top oven didn't work from Day 1 and just kept heating until it was like a furnace and although an engineer came out it still cooks too hot so will request that the appliance is checked as it is far too unreliable to ensure good results.,Approved
"When AEG washer drier was being delivered, the delivery men told my boyfriend that it was a great product and that he had good taste. I choose everything so he said no no my partner choose it and she does a lot of research into anything. I wanted quality and something which will last. 

There’s lots of different settings to choose from and what’s great is it’s very intuitive, so it chooses the amount of time it needs to be on for. My clothes come out cleaner then they have before. 

It’s so easy to use that my boyfriend does all the laundry now. I’m so pleased and would recommend this to anyone. It’s slightly more but it’s worth it. Because you can’t argue with results.",Approved
So far so good. Apart from ironing and folding it does everything you could thing of interms of programmes.,Approved
Looks stunning . Easy to use would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new cooker . Should have bought it years ago,Approved

At first I found all the programmes and the instruction booklet hard to understand. Now I have used it a few times it is good. The first time I put it on for a wash and dry it took five and a half hours. Far too long. Now I have it down to an hour and half for a wash and roughly the same to dry it. Haven't used all the programmes but so far it seems a good machine. Like the way it measures the load as you put it in.,Approved

Took awhile to get used to the machine as it is smarter than me - re-read the book again and again we are now friends. It is a brilliant machine - very pleased with my purchase.,Approved
I am really impressed with this fridge. I went from a larder style which was much bigger than this and was a bit concerned that there wouldn't be enough space in it but I was pleasantly surprised. Also very quiet. Would highly recommend.,Approved
"So ours is an integral fridge freezer, not sure if this model is purely integral. It’s fitted into a Wickes kitchen, and the wooden doors do not open wide enough, to open the fridge door wide enough, to give us full access to the salad boxes. There is not enough cabinet space to fit 165 degree hinges. Need to visit wicked showroom to see if there is a solution",Approved
"The product is excellent in all ways apart from one, the fittings for the doors to attach to the cupboard are made of thin plastic and keep pulling off when opening.",Approved
This was a replacement from AEG for a machine that was not performing. I am over the moon with this new machine. It does everything I would expect of a tumble drier. The clothes come out dry and it dries very quickly. AEG has certainly come up in my estimation.,Approved
"I have been very impressed up to now, it is a really quiet and efficient machine, the quality of the wash is first class.",Approved
"Everything is great with the machine regarding its washing / drying ability. The only issue is with the detergent drawer, which feels flimsy and liable to breaking if pulled out a little too hard.",Approved
"This is without doubt one of the quietest machines available. Super silent even on the fastest spins with a full load.
A wide variety of programmes which wash your clothes etc really well.

I'm very pleased with this purchase! i never had an induction hob and i have to say it's great!heat up very quick!Also the oven is great!cook everything evenly and there is no need to keep turning things around to avoid to be burn on side and not cook on the other. I highly recommend it!,Approved

What an amazing washing machine from AEG. As always great quality and features. Thank you!,Approved
"really pleased easy to use, and keep clean, instant heat.and instant turn off the heat, i was used to a gas hob but wouldnt go back really pleased :-)",Approved
"Only had this for a few weeks but so far very good. Washes really well and dries well leaving clothes feeling soft.
there are different drying settings so you can go for either totally dry ready to put away or iron dry. the clothes come put pretty wrinkle free. the washing machine is easy to use, and seems well made,there is a feature to do a quick wash which shortens washing time but still washes extremely well.",Approved
"Easy to use, great capacity, efficient washing and drying excellent results. I am delighted with my purchase.",Approved
I have bought cooker and after a month there was colour change on the surface of the hob and when i called them they weren't helpfull at all. To not to help they blamed me using a product which caused discoloration which i haven't even use chemical . I m so regret of wasting my money on this brand. I m really happy with my other appliances from different brands which never had a problem but withing first month i had thisreally bad discolouration. i ll never recomment their productsit was a waste of money and time,Approved

VERY NICE APPEARANCE & PERFORMANCE. I HOPE THIS CONTINUES OVER THE COMING YEARS,Approved
"For build quality and sturdy construction, you cant fault this cooker. It feels like it will be as strong and shiney in ten years as it is now.
But thatswhere it ends.
The worst thing about this cooker are the shelves, or more to the point, the 'flame guards'.
With them on, you might as well get rid of at least 2 of the shelves as you cant fit them all in. The guards are so high that the next shelf or the large roasting pan, simply will not fit on the racks above it. So if you have one on the bottom, your next shelf is practically at the top. and if you have one in the middle, its the only shelf that will fit. 
It completely nullifies the point of such a large oven space.
And dont even bother trying to get them in the top oven!
The guards can be removed but Without them, you run the risk of pushing them in too far, and you will soon start seeing the back of the shelf glowing a nice bright red colour, and when it cools, a nice darkened burnt shelf.
I dont know if this is a common fault either, but our top oven frequently goes out. It has done since day 1. You stick your oven chips in, go out 15 minutes later to a cold oven. IT happens randomly and some days it doesn't happen at all. Then other days will see the oven go out 3 times in 20 minutes. So frustrating. It only seems to be the top oven not the main oven. We haven't used the grill so cant comment on that.
Cooking times also seem very slow. Said chips take about 35-40 minutes if you like them even remotely crispy and a couple of chicken breasts will leave you waiting at least an hour. so much longer than the dilapidated old thing it replaced. 
Quite possibly the worst £800 ever spent.",Approved
"We replaced our previous Zanussi Fridge which had lasted over 10 years which in the current climate of only 1 or 2 years guarantee was
value for money. Compare that with our previous one built by my father who was a refrigeration Engineer that lasted 50 years how times change",Approved
"Easy to use, Great features, Good even cooking temperature and it looks good",Approved
"We have had our cooker for 18 months and had the engineer out to it three times to try and fix the same fault, with no success. The top oven and grill don't stay on once lit. Frustratingly, they just switch off at totally random times. Or buyers are having the same problem....very disappointing for a quality brand and I won't be buying anything made by AEG again.",Approved
"Hob is amazing!
Oven cooks to perfection!
Family say I haven't burnt anything since using new cooker!",Approved
Very easy to use and as great features love the colour very happy with the oven,Approved
"This is a very good piece of kit, the only bad thing I would say about it is that your limited in the amount of things you can get in the refrigerator unit as the back of this unit remains moist and this limits the amount of back space you have. The freezer compartment has no issues at all.",Approved
"With the raised edges of the oven shelves it is very difficult to pick up a flat oven tray without pulling the shelf out. I didn't notice this when purchasing the cooker. Also when using a frying pan on the top of the range the handle catches the rim unless using the back burners which means you can't use the front one at the same time. 
 Very disappointed!",Approved

Installed by a Currie contractor whose bods frankly wanted to get in and get out quickly without ensuring the levelling was absolutely correct and without explaining the controls fully.

Its as close to a high street coffee I have had, right there at home.

The machine is elegant, sounds sad, but I love the led lights that light up your cup and dim when you turn it off. The frother is amazing, rinses clean and makes loads of foam from minimal milk.",Approved
"Over the moon with this cooker. The hob is brilliant with the wok ring, the ovens are massive and very quick to heat up. The steam vents on the top of the hob let the steam out the ovens so you don't get a face full of steam when you open the oven doors. Just brilliant very very pleased with my purchase.",Approved
"Had this for 3 months now - fantastic little machine. Reliable, quick and easy and great tasting coffee.

"Ample storage for our needs, although I have added an extra shelf, appears to hold temperature well (don't have a thermometer in yet), not the quietest of appliances but not excessively noisy. No problems encountered yet.",Approved
I am not entirely pleased with this as there seems to be water on the back wall of the integrated fridge freezer which doesn't go away. Inside it doesn't hold as muchas I would like and I wish it came with bottle holder to lie bottles flat,Approved
"I always thought a washing machine was a washing machine and there was little difference in what they can do. This may well be true, but this machine is great to use. I had to read the manual but in doing so, I have had the cleanest laundry ever.

I love the way it weighs the load and advises you for how much detergent to put in. The XXL drum let you put in a really big load, I have put a full set of super king bedding in and reckon I could have got another double set in as well.

It is very quiet and for me, has a look and feel of quality about it.

The light inside the drum is great for checking that all socks are accounted for.",Approved

"Bought as replacement for earlier model which had worn out after over 10 years of use in several houses. Extra fridge space is useful but as height was an issue is the tallest I could fit in.

"Moved to a new house and wanted a freestanding induction cooker as I'd got used to the induction hob in our old home. So far this AEG doesn't disappoint, intuitive operation, rapid heat up, user friendly and great looking. The ovens offer even and consistant heat distribution - even the conventional top oven, making it great for baking roasting and more. The only issue I have is that the hob top is very slippery, so your pans slide about when you stir the contents - this wasn't an issue on my old Panasonic built-in hob, which had a slightly textured surface.",Approved

"We bought this item to replace a previous one which had failed after four years use. The new model, which has several improvements over its predecessor, is very easy to use being light weight and very manoeuvrable. It has plenty of endurance for its size, cleaning our 2-bedroom flat on full power on one charge with something to spare. The removable hand-held cleaner is very handy, and the ability to fit brushes to it for cleaning settees and chairs is an added bonus. We are very pleased with our purchase.",Approved
"I love this machine it is light to use, easily moves around furniture and the light is a great help for under beds and tables. The on board tools are very useful and fit neatly in to the stand and the animal one is amazing. I particularly like the fact that this easily transforms into a hand held machine with the same efficiency as the main vacuum cleaner. The price was also very competitive I would have no hesitation in recommending it to others.",Approved
"Easy to clean the cooker top and seems robust - my other half has left empty pans on the hob by mistake several times and the top seems to have been unmarked . . . . so far.

Little residual heat left in the hob after use, which is why I bought the cooker, so safer with a young child. That said, the little monster can quite easily turn the hobs on so a lockout feature or additional switch at the back of the cooker top would have helped. 

Most times easy to control the hob but sometimes hard to get the exact power level wanted, more so when the cooker top is wet.

Heats pans very quickly and is great for boiling small quantities of water for e.g. steaming.

Induction hob is generally exactly what we wanted, but one unforeseen shortcoming was that as soon as the pan is removed, for example to mix the contents, it loses all heat. Gas is best, incandescent next. This is an obvious limitation of the induction method and not a fault with the cooker per se. 

Ovens offer a lot of flexibility with respect to heat source (top, bottom, both, fan, etc) but with the status of only one shown at a time they can be awkward to use. They cook evenly back to front and side to side but we haven't got the top-bottom heating right yet for cakes. I'm sure that understanding will come and we have not tried the fan oven yet.

Clock / timer features could be more intuitive. Clock doesn't have any memory so even the briefest of power cuts will reset the clock.

Nice clean styling across the top and front isn't too bad - not great, but inoffensive enough.

Developed a fault after about three months. Fixed under warranty with no quibbles but needed two visits.

Overall I'm happy and would buy another one, or at least another induction hob but I'd always have a nagging doubt about longevity.",Approved
"Could be improved by making temperature control digital, which would help with accuracy.",Approved
"The machine is ok and washes well but it vibrates more than I expected and more than previous AEG machines. I
have made sure the machine is level and it is on a concrete floor so I can only assume it is because it is the way it has been made.",Approved

"Initially after purchase oven did not work. The hob was taken apart and the fault appeared to be a bad connection from touch panel to ribbon cable. Now everything appears to work satisfactory, easy to clean, and looks great,",Approved
"Not impressed by support, which is basically nonexistent. It does appear to me that AEG make it as difficult, if not impossible for anyone to obtain support. There is not an AEG contact number or address on the website. I would not expect that for what is supposed to be an international company. The only number given is for support to D&G, who is a subcontractor to Electrolux, who is in turn a subcontractor to AEG! D&G are, it appeared only interested in selling additional insurance. A fact made clear when I rang their number to register the product, in the vain hope that it would lead to support. However, they were very interested in selling a 5 year plan but little interested in much else. They actually tried to sell me a 5 year plan before I had taken the dishwasher from its box! I asked them if the product was so unreliable that I would need it but basically this interest only in selling insurance gave me the impression that they belived the product to be unreliable. Having just spent £600+ in the belief in reliability I was less than amused. They did give me a telephone number which was of little use but after another half an hour it lead me into a blank wall or total resistance to assist in installion support. On the AEG website I was promised all sorts of advantages in registering, none of which materialised. I received several emails all from a DONOTREPLY@ email address, which basically says quite categorically do not now try to contact anyone in relation to this product under any circumstances. None of the several emails received give any contact or contract details. 
To date I have not received a reference number, policy number or any confirmation that my dishwasher is registered, nor am I aware of any contact numbers in the event of a breakdown. I do not therefore know if D&W, Electrolux or AEG have actually provided my dishwasher with the 2 year warranty. I have not a single piece of evidence on paper, or digital to confirm my warranty, nor have I been given any contact numbers. Not have I seen any T&Cs. 
To date I am no more happy about this lack of attention to business or consideration than I would have been if I had dealt with some money grabbing seller off the internet who is equally as un-contactable.
I just hope it doesn't break down in the two year period as I just know it is going to be hours and hours of work on the phone trying to get a repair done. If it fails after the two years then I will throw the AEG out and buy something else from someone else who is prepared to provide me with evidence of support and contact details. 
It is issues like this that usually end up in the Saturday Telegraph and Sunday Times.

For these reasons I cannot recommend anyone to buy AEG. At my age I can do without this aggravation, which I believe to be totally unecessary. I think it is a disgrace if this is how AEG treat all their customers.


PS : the T&Cs for this allow CRR & AEG to alter my text and also require me ot indemnify AEG against any claims thereby arising. Surely this is illegal in itself as you are asking people to indemnify AEG against their own possible causation of an issue? So I don't agree to your terms and I type this after I have ticked the box, being an amendment to your terms. I am forced to tick the box to send this communication believing from experience and information available that this is the only way to contact AEG, insofar as I know of no other means of contacting AEG.",Rejected

This product has great features and is easy to use. Easy to clean and looks fantastic,Approved
"The feature of steam on this machine is so good I cannot praise it enough, it cuts the ironing down particularly on the bed linen and t-shirts, I am extremely impressed with the 20 min wash feature as it is so efficient. On the whole this is a fantastic washing machine",Approved
This cooker has many reatures and it takes a while to master but all of the main features are intuitive.,Approved
"I was so looking forward to my cooker arriving. Sadly the build quality is poor, razor sharp edges on rear, bumps on metal trim, door handle not attached properly, grill rack discoloured, poor customer service - contacted AEG twice about issues but no reply for weeks",Approved
A lot better coffee maker than my old AEG Lavazza machine that soon packed up and wasn't worth repairing,Approved
This is the second model of this cooker that I've owned but my first experience of an induction hob and I love it! The cooker looks sleek and contemporary and is intuitive to use. What more can you ask?,Approved
"Great quality, design, so easy to use! Brilliant product it was just ashame that mine was delivered scratched and dirty not what I expected when you pay that sort of money for an appliance.",Approved
"This is my first induction cooker and I love it. I really only need the basic functions, ie using the bottom oven and the hob and I find it very simple to use. Much better than my old gas cooker. Highly recommend. My only criticism is that there are some sharp bits of unfinished metal at the back which I manager to cut my finger on moving the cooker. Small point but could easily have been finished off safely",Rejected
"Very pleased with this cooker. Does exactly what it says, love the digital controls.",Approved
"Very pleased with the ease of use and the delicious foamy lattes that I v
Can indulge in",Approved
Love the milk steamer so much easier & efficient. The temperature is always just right,Approved
An excellent machine of a convenient size to fit safely on a worktop. Produces good coffee in a quick time without noise or vibration.,Approved
"This appliance has performed perfectly since installation and has all the features anyone would need. Easy to use and every function works as expected.
I would recommend this to anyone and have already done so.",Approved
The oven comes to heat quickly and is great for baking cakes. It is very easy to keep it clean as there is no buttons to clean around,Approved
"I am very pleased overall with my purchase. It makes great coffee easily, it is very compact and looks great in my kitchen, It is easy to keep clean, remove used pods and has different level settings which again are very easy to change for the size of cup. My only comment is that the manual states to prog coffee amount to press for whichever coffee type you want ie Cafe Crema the button will start flashing. Keep the button pressed and release when the desired coffee amount is reached. This does nothing at all, the machine still cuts out at the same time regardless of whether you do or you don't keep your finger on the button which means for a mug of coffee you either have to press it several times or top up with hot water. It does however make a great strong latte.",Approved
Love the fact that there are no knobs to get full of grease!,Approved
"Very happy with this coffee machine, the build quality is excellent, with a choice of cup sizes for automatic cutoff. It is quite a compact machine, so takes up little space on the worktop, but the cold water tank might be a little too small heavy users. The used capsules drop into a small removable tray, so you don't need to dispose of them each time you use, it just once in a while (every 12 uses maybe?). I also bought the separate milk heater & frother as this function is not included in the coffee machine",Approved
Freezes ok keeps everything frozen it in a utility room so we don’t hear it running and doses the job very well,Approved
"I like how the programmes are easy to use. 
Quiet machine - I have it in my kitchen and you would hardly know it was on. 
There is a fantastic spin and the clothes come out exceptionally dry unlike other washing machines I have previously had. 
Would certainly recommend an AEG washing machine to anyone.",Approved
It is very good for making soups and curry. You must try it.,Approved
Simple by design but awesome in function. Less is more,Approved
"I phoned to have my faulty machine replaced, logged the return by email, and I have still heard nothing from anybody regarding a replacement being sent.",Rejected
Keeps everything well frozen with a minimum running time keeping down costs.,Approved
"Bought this to replace an ageing gas hob, wanted something that looks good and easy to clean. This fits the bill on all counts, extremely pleased so far",Approved
"This washing machine is really quiet, quick and has great programmes.",Approved
Purchased two of these freezers and have them side by side under counter in kitchen. Biggest plus is that they are automatic defrost. They are a nice height off floor so no strobbling about low down but still have 3 drawers. Warning bleep regarding door open is an excellent idea.,Approved
"Lovely cooker looks great! Great features, can’t wait to start baking, overall really pleased",Approved
"3 days of use and had to call AEG they came out and could not fix it and the parts are on order",Approved
"Very pleased with our new fridge freezer, it looks great, is quiet and efficient. Has loads of space in the fridge and we particularly like the huge drawers at the bottom for holding salad stuff, veg etc.",Approved
"Nice features including alarm if the door is left open for more than 2 minutes, a very audible temperature warning and very smooth opening and closing drawers and easy closing door.",Approved
"The large door is perfect, it allows me to load much more in one go. And I love the chrome door, stylish!",Approved
This vacuum cleaner has a fantastic suction and the low wattage will ensure electricity bills aren't too high. Cable length is super also.,Approved
Very pleased with this so far. The door's a little hard to open but at least keeps grandchildren out!,Approved
"Stylish looking freezer. Good quality product. Easy to use, love the clear shelves, you can see what's inside without having to pull out drawers. Plenty of space inside. Would highly recommend.",Approved
The dishwasher functions beautifully. I might have liked the option for a shorter/lower temperature cycle but overall I am very happy.,Approved
Good wash takes a while to get drying program right but once you do fairly good product,Approved
"A nice, easy to use unit. Very even heating. Could do with a more usefule timer.",Approved
"having the small freezer box is a great advantage, very quite",Approved
Very easy to organise and therefore view the contents.,Approved
Nice machine but could do with being quieter on the spin. The touch controls are a little too sensitive and would like to be able to switch the end alarm on or off properly with a switch not just temporarily.,Approved
I was a little apprehensive before I got my induction hob but could not be happier. Very quick to heat up and instantly down to simmering heat. Would certainly recommend to anyone interested in updated their hob,Approved
"Great freezer. very easy to see what is in each draw.
Only minor point is that the target temperature is displayed and there does not seem to be any way of seeing the actual temperature.",Approved
AEG have come up with a design to put a smile on your face. Inside and out of this freezer.,Approved
"plenty off storage, looks great, very quiet. very pleased",Approved
"My 70th birthday present to myself.... Great coffee and simple to operate. My friends are really impressed..... Now a fab choice of coffee available....can’t go wrong. Well done, AGA! x",Approved
Design is good and the oven fit good in IKEA cupboard.,Approved
"1. The weighing of loaded items will prevent the overloading which we are all guilty of!
2. It is kind to the environment by advising on how much detergent to use
3. Energy consumption will be very noticeable in the electricity and water consumption bills
4. It is so quiet - you need the beep to know when the washing is complete!
5. Unsure about the need for the internal light",Approved
"A very well made, easy to use coffee maker that you can make lots of different types of coffee due to using pods. The pods are to costly to buy, and there are a good selection of tastes to choose from, nice to just froth up the milk and add horlicks for a nice evening drink.",Approved
"I get bored cooking very quickly and wander off,but this technology is so good that I can bring the saucepan to the boil / temperature in seconds...so now I don't end up burning or over boiling anything. Oh and my husband loves it so much he now cooks..win win for me.",Approved
So far so good better fit and design than old model,Approved
This is my first electric induction Hob and it is even better than all the reviews I have read....,Approved
"Incredibly pleased with this product. Chose it as a budget option really and couldn't be more pleased. It's compact, but still takes a good load, it's economical and the super-quick wash is just that.",Approved

Very impressed with the quality of the vacuum and size ideal for upstairs and also using on the car,Approved
"I don't usually get excited about such things, but this machine really is superb. I love the touch screen control, and especially the time save functions. It is so quiet (even on top spin) compared to my old Hotpoint machine, it means I can have my utility room door open & still watch TV in the evenings without needing to adjust the volume on the remote! 
My washing is noticeably less creased, muddy kids clothes & rugby kit are no problem, and I love the super-quick 20 minute wash. 
Fabulous machine - would highly recommend!",Approved
"The door doesn't fit properly because of poor hinge design, causing the door to drop slightly and makes shutting door difficult.

Machine has poorly designed water inlet valve that fails at the slightest change in water pressure - or possibly randomly.",Approved
Tge machine is very good and majes the best coffee ever. I love it,Approved
"For a 15 bar machine I find it very slow taking over 21/2 mins a 100 mil
other than that the backup responce is zero sent a load of request Emails to check if faulty not one reply",Approved
"My wife and I bought the Fantasia Plus 'a modo mio' cofee machine online from the Lavazza website. It arrived very quickly and was well packed.
Firstly the machine consistently makes delicious perfect coffee. I have tried Nespresso, Tassimo and Dolce Gusto machines and though they all make a reasonable acceptable coffee none of them compare to the AEG Lavazza Fantasia Plus which has proved to be vastly superior in taste, operation and features. I have not tasted coffee this good outside of Italy! Lavazza do a huge range of blends which should suit every taste, I have tried them all and have not found one which I didnt like though I have settled on a few personal favourites. 
The machine is very easy to setup and is quick and simple to use with touch controls. You can simply select the default settings or use the many features to tailor your drink just how you want. Ristretto, Espresso, Lungo, americano, cappuccino, latte, flat white, macchiato, mocha and many more are all possible, you can also make hot chocolate and even cold drinks like milkshakes and iced coffee. The machine is very attractively designed and looks professional but is neat taking up very little space. Other features include and good sized water tank, auto descaling, internal storage of used pods (up to 10), self cleaning of milk/foam attachment (steam) and an optional water softener. Apart from Lavazza's own coffee pods there are compatible alternatives which will also work well but I prefer Lavazza genuine pods as the coffee is such good quality. I thoroughly recommend this machine it really is the cannine's danglers!",Approved
The 3 suction varations are good inovation and gives the alliance easy to handle,Rejected
"Rather light weight and not very powerful but does the job.
Easy to use and has a light.
Could do with an extension tube for corners and cleaner emptying process for dust compartment.",Approved
"This is one of the most powerful cordless cleaners, and it feels like its self propelled gently pulling through dust and dirt lifting and cleaning. On full power it can to shut off on carpets, but switch to power one to two and your are fine. I had a BOSCH before and it was good , but is was heavy, cleaning the brush wasn't as simple as the AEG, which has a button for that-highly recommend",Approved
Boils extremely fast and the automatic function is great.,Approved
"25yrs plus on gas now after 4 weeks on induction starting to enjoy. Induction appears more controllable, pans are easier to clean - no burn on. Hob very easy to wipe clean and dry/polish with kitchen towel. Timer could be useful!",Approved
Great fridge. A replacement for a LG fridge/freezer. Keeps everything to cool temperature as desired. I love it.,Approved
Machine has good program features and spin speed. It is very light weight and will move around at times if the load is uneven,Approved
"the appliance is contempory in design, slender, and as pleasing asthetics. the digital control system, and ring settings range, are touch responsive, and respond quickly to any change in temperature settings. the surface is easily cleaned.",Approved
"This compact cleaner is the dynamo of hand vacs. It does an amazing job on stairs, dispensing with unwanted pet hairs in a third of the time. It is adaptable between different surfaces and is more ergonomic than any other cleaner I have tried.  I had seen 5 star ratings before I bought it but it deserves more. Can't wait to use it on the car! Well done AEG! !",Approved
"This is perfect for the car and the stairs. It is very powerful and easily picks up dog hair. I am really pleased with the performance, quality and price.",Approved
"the unit works very well in all respects the suction is powerful enough for stairs and car cleaning my only criticism
is there is no cable clip for plug storage this is why i have rated design as good not excellent",Approved
I bought this for the car only. Feels a little heavy after a while but due to its power it gives car a good clean. Would recommend this over the other less powerful car vacuums.,Approved
"Happy with first machine, but only lasted 21 months before faulty, replaced with 2 further machines under warranty, but leaked immediately on use, tried contacting AEG but impossible to get through on phone or by email, caused so much stress, time and money, three 80 mile round trips back to the purchase store, so would not recommend this coffee machine and angry and disappointed with AEG customer service, or should I say lack of!!",Rejected
"Very sceptical about buying a cordless vac. Will it be powerful enough to pick up our little dogs hair? will the power last long enough to do the whole house? will it charge up quick enough? is it worth the price? how long will the battery last, all these were questions we pondered before buying one.
I researched them all, and the AEG CX-8 seemed the best buy to me. It is lightweight, soooo easy to use, has 3 power settings and easily cleans the whole of our 4 bed, house on full power with power to spare. My wife will now actually do the vacuuming (not sexist, I usually do it!) she says the AEG is life changing, so quick and does a brilliant job, the small dirt collector is easily emptied and cleaned, we leave it on charge all the time and it is so easy to just pick up and quickly vac any little mess. We should have bought one years ago.",Approved
"Simple to use, easy to clean, small and neat on the counter top.",Approved
"I’m new to Induction cooking but cannot praise it high enough. This hob is so easy to use. When you need to reduce the temperature the heat reduces immediately just like gas but far cleaner. I like the ‘stop & go’ feature which reduces heat to a minimum if you are called away from the cooker and returns to previous setting when it is touched again. An excellent product, thoroughly recommended.",Approved
"Simple to use and set up.
A fantastic range of coffe pods and we can use goat milk and soya Milk. Easy to clean and makes a great coffee",Approved
Very pleased with this product. Is very powerful and picks up my long haired cat's hairs with ease. Long lead which reaches up my stairs easily.,Approved
Love it! Such a small machine but ALOT of power! Its a doddle using on the stairs and furniture and great for hard to get to spaces! Very easy to empty - Its brilliant!,Approved
This hoover is a pleasure to use on stairs as it is light and has excellent suction. Nice long flex for car cleaning too.,Approved
"I have only used a few times but happy so far, light and easy to use, easy to clean filter etc, easy everything thanks :)",Approved
"THIS IS A VERY USER FRIENDLY WASHING MACHINE IT IS VERY EASY TO USE, IS VERY QUITE AND FOR A SMALL MACHINE HAS A GOOD CAPACITY AND SEVERAL SHORT PROGRAMMES TO CHOOSE FROMWITH GOOD SPIN SPEEDS",Approved
"Had this for about 5 weeks now, bought as a pair with the matching fridge. The freezer looks really classy and is perfect in terms of storage with well designed drawers on runners, the only downside is that this freezer is noticeably noisy when running ( which seems to be a lot of the time ) giving out a sort of high pitched rattly type sound, more like an old freezer which is coming to the end of it's life. This is disappointing for a new  appliance, all the more so because the matching fridge is so quiet I do not even know it is on, why is the freezer so much noisier than the matching fridge?    Would have been 5 stars if it was quiet like the fridge.",Approved
"I was puzzled by what they call oko mix which basically means the everything is mixed before it hits you clothes. So what, right? my towels feel softer, not a bit deal but its the little things. It's also really quiet to even on a spin. early days but so far so good.",Approved
"It just does the job well. Very happy with my purchase.
No fuss - looks nice - so convenient to stand upright on its own support.
The light on the front is an added feature which is useful if your eyesight
isn't so good.",Approved
This vacumn is just brilliant! it has so much suction and an hours battery life. It couldn’t be better.,Approved
"Pleased so far with the dishwasher performance, was easy start using, clear instructions for initial preparation and use. Was unsure about using without any visible controls or timers, but, the floor projection lights are quite good.",Approved
"Manual a bit poor and it shows very long washing times, however these are normally halved after 15 minutes as it senses what load and modifies the time required.

Only had it a day so not had chance to test it fully yet.",Approved
Absolutely delighted with this product so light as easy to use,Approved
"Just what we was looking for , a underunit frost free freezer with AEG build quality and reliability.",Approved
"Despite measuring for this, it’s surprised us with just how bulky a design it is. A simple exchange of chimney hoods turned into a long job of removing architrave, tops of units and tiles just to accommodate the chimney, that’s without the extension on. Absolute pain. Instructions are vague and don’t point out that the carbon filter isn’t required if it is installed as an extraction unit. Lights are great, the unit is noisy but effective.",Approved
"Excellent equipment, does all expected of it, stylishly!",Approved
"Easy to install and freezes quickly. one little niggle though drawers are not as nearly robust as I thought they would be, more plasticy than usual",Approved
"I absolutely love my AEG washing machine! First of all, it can easily accommodate family loads and runs nicely in the background. 
Quiet! My AEG is oh so quiet! Clothes come out nice and clean! I love the steam function - not everything needs to go to the dry cleaners anymore. But best of all, this will cost me roughly £10-£12 a year to run! I just put my wash on and my AEG does it all. Love love love my AEG!",Approved
great design of case and colour easy to read temperature and easy functions. possible change inside could be a pull down front draw.,Approved
Good quality product - compact and powerful and very well made.,Approved
See review summary for further details as this is the only word needed to describe everything about this product.,Approved
"Loving the fast 1600 spin speed, really helps reduce the drying time. 
The steam function, is a brainwave as it helps reduce ironing of my shirts. 
Love that I’m using half or even a quarter the amount of washing powder due to the salt dispenser, it helps soften the water and just works great. 
Love all the extra functions, all the washing is just, well, feels and smells better. 
Very worthwhile investment.",Approved
"We've had the B&Q cheapo, Electolux, Hotpoint. This beats the lot. Food in comparison is so hot. It cooks on time. The small oven is for using, not a year in the life of...waiting. Of course the real test is of time. Come back in 2 years for an update. I have a mate who bought an AEG double s/h 10 years ago. It still works well",Rejected
"Lovely to use, very quiet, real feel of quality. Great that you can set the temperature digitally and that it regulates temperature so well. Everything we've cooked has been perfect, really don't know what the other reviewer was on about, perhaps they worked for Bosch!",Approved
"One of the most intuitive pieces of equipment I’ve used. Has excellent control and the flexibility to place labs in various locations means we can move them around easily.

The power boost button is ridiculously quick.

We have an AEG hood and it connects with the hob - a fantastic bit of useful technology.",Approved
It's good work and nice outside. looks very good working and no to much noise.,Approved
"The oven works well and the way it supports the internal racks is very useful.
The alarm also has various settings that are very appreciated.",Approved
"Looks good but control panel could feel a bit more solid. Multiple functions are good including steam. Good value for money. I use timer function a lot, so would be best in separate button. Baking produces good even results. Easy to clean",Approved
"Fantastic product,the features on this are fantastic,great style and would recommend to anyone.",Approved
"Oven heats up very quickly, easy to keep clean and price was very reasonable.",Approved
The main issue is that the clock turns off after 5 mins. What a strange thing to do. Why have a clock at all if it is not to be displayed constantly?,Approved
"Replacement for previous freezer after 20 years. Early days but working fine - design only good, since top hinge has no cover so the metal hinge is exposed, seems rather penny pinching considering the cost.",Approved
I’ve only been using this oven for a month so haven’t used all its features. However I’m impressed with the large oven space and simple controls.,Approved
"I'm still getting to grips with all the features of my new oven but so far I'm really pleased. I like the look of it too, it looks solid and  stylish. The food sensor is the feature I have used the most  and I am loving the results. It helps not to have to worry about getting the red meat cooked right, it means I can concentrate on other aspects of the meal. It's nice and sturdy and the racks can be removed easily which makes cleaning easy.",Rejected
This cooker is very good we like the hob and the different oven features,Approved
"This is my second AEG oven and so far I'm pleased, it's been great.. I'm happy with the consistency the food sensor offers  for cooking meat, red meat especially. It means  I can  concentrate on the rest of my meal while I know the meat will come out the way I want it to without me having to keep an eye on it every five minutes.  Great buy",Rejected
The product fully charges but then only works for 10 seconds. It will have to be returned to the maker,Approved
we looked long and hard for the model that best suited us. this has proved to be a good choice,Approved
"This is our first AEG oven, and we are absolutely delighted. The features are great, it is easy to use, efficient in use, and feels like a real quality product.",Approved
Achieved wonderful results over Christmas from the roast dinner to the cakes that followed . A very easy oven to use and in our opinion at a great price.,Approved
"In 2009 we had a complete kitchen refurbishment with all units built in. All cooking appliances were AEG. Recently the microwave failed as a result of one of the door clips breaking. Annoying as this was, we had a like for like replacement and although it is basically a similar unit there is a noticeable improvement in performance, especially the re heating mode. It’s much quicker than its predecessor and food reheated comes out piping hot in double quick time. I’m keeping fingers crossed that the rest of the units don’t require replacing so soon. At least not all at the same time!!",Approved
"We bought this as a package of appliances when we refurbished our kitchen. I’m sure this does much more than reheat and defrost foods, though this is our main family use for a microwave. I would add that the after care service is amazing and would recommend that everyone registers their appliances. Our microwave developed a fault, the week before Christmas, I phoned the help service on Monday and we had an engineers visit by the Friday, all fixed and ready to use.",Approved
"Loving this machine it has all the features and more that I need/want it is quiet when both washing and spinning.
Have used the steam option to clean cushion covers which state dry clean only and they came out really well.
Only one thing I would like more options on the spinning some of the programs are only 1200 and you cannot increase them to 1600 but this is a very minor thing which would not put me off buying another or recommending to anyone. Brilliant machine, brilliant price and washes far better than my old one which I thought was pretty good until using this one.",Approved
"Oven feature is fine but it is not fit for microwaving. At best, it will give uneven results - not cooked on one side whilst burned on the other. At worst, there is a concern that it could prove to be a health hazard as it is unreliable in heating items to the correct temperature for safe levels.",Rejected
"We have had a AEG washer dry some years ago,very good ( made in Germany )
This machine has had a rattle on spin from day one, we have had three engineers out to fix it. It's now so bad you need to get out of the room add close the door.
I have no confidence in AEG,",Rejected
This is the best oven I've ever used. I love the steam bake function to make lovely bread and sponges.,Approved
I have found this oven to be great to use. Very quiet while being used. Easy to keep clean,Approved
"Simple to use, accurate temperature control and the steam function is an elegant way to improve the baking process. I find the countdown timer very useful and am enjoying using this oven.",Approved
"This is a great oven, my favourite so far! I love it! Made the best roast potatoes!",Approved
Love using this oven but wish it had a keep food warm function,Approved
"Good machine initially had some issues whic aeg fixed.

The water could be hotter when it makes my coffee but overall satisfied with the product.",Approved
"Overall I am very pleased with the oven. The features include conventional heat or just either top or bottom heat. There is even a pizza setting, although I haven't had the chance to try that out yet. The push in and out buttons make it easy to clean the outside of the oven although being a bit short I found it difficult at first to see the icons to select a setting but have soon got used to this. My only quibble would be that there could have been a detachable handle for the grill pan to avoid keep using oven gloves.",Approved
The various options with the oven make it extremely versatile.,Approved
"Very happy with this oven - it cooks really well, looks great and is quite easy to keep clean.
It heats up very quickly and has great features.I like its large 72L capacity.
I have yet to try steam function.",Approved
"Reasonably priced considering some of the features. Easy to use, clear instructions and looks good.",Approved
Very controllable heat and very quick responce to controls. Very quick heat-up time and transfer of heat to pan and contents.,Approved
"Looks very nice on the kitchen, modern. Easy to use, fast cooking.",Approved
"I love being able to adjust the shelves and know that all my shopping is going to fit in! I nearly didn't go for this size as I was worried I wouldn't be able to access the top shelf, but now I'm so glad I did. It's wonderful being able to stock up when the family is coming over. It runs well and has so far been very reliable! But then I've always chosen Zanussi because their products have always lasted me years and years.",Approved
Very simple to operate with touch button it makes reasonable noise but at least it does its work. Like the ease of cleaning the panels as some others are difficult to remove.,Approved
Took me a bit of time to get use to all the features but love it now,Approved
"We are loving our new double oven, still finding our way with the many functions for various styles of cooking and baking. only minor thing we struggle with is being able to see the settings as when dial moves round it is difficult to know if button at correct setting as quite high up",Approved
"Really pleased with my new AEG double oven, it's great having a fan in the top oven as well, much quicker than my gas cooker. Only disappointment is the light in the tope oven is too far down and one cannot see how the food is cooking. Don't like the lip on the front of the shelves, especially on the top oven, not able to slide dishes out to get hold of them easily, sliders on all shelves would be better.",Approved
"A good washing machine - programmes cover all different types of washes needed, and more to spare. Some of the longer wash times can be shortened and you are able to choose rinse, spin etc independently of wash cycles. Short 30 mins cycle useful.

Easy to install - I a 5' nothing lady and I did all but tightening the connections. Manual is easy to follow and controls easy to use.

Does what it's supposed to do.",Approved
Very satisfied with the product but lights in the oven  stopped working within a week of installation.,Approved
"This oven (BPE742320M) simply handles every challenge it is presented with, from proving gluten free bread, heating the perfect frozen pizza with crispy base to roasting the traditional Sunday roast. The user manual is a great starting point to try out the wide range of settings, they really do make a difference to how the food is cooked and well worth taking the time to familiarise yourself with them. The food sensor is a great accessory (included) and allows you to consistently cook dishes exactly to your own preferences, no more over done beef! The control panel is one of the most intuitive I have ever used on an oven, simple, clear and so easy to use. The pyrolytic cleaning function is amazing, who thought cleaning an oven could be so simple and effective, all you need is a damp cloth to clean out the ash residue, simply brilliant. Overall, a great looking oven with clean lines, easy to use, easy to clean and produces excellent results time after time.",Approved

"The new design of this oven is very sleek and modern and fits well into the kitchen.  It looks the part but does it do the job....... in a word YES!

I admit to not being the best of cook and a little bit of a dummy with regards to modern technology but this cooker does it for you.  

The assisted cooking allows you to tell the cooker what meat you have, how you want it cooking and it does the rest for you. Easy! It does allow you to manually do this aswell but why would you when you have a cooker that does it for you?

It is very easy to use turn the dial and push to select - if I can use it anyone can.

Trying to give a fair and balanced review and thinking about negatives......as of yet I can't find one...... the smell when you have to first switch on the oven is a little off putting.... i would advise to prep your oven on a day when you can have the door or windows open.

So far I am very happy with this oven and long may it continue.",Approved
I am delighted with the oven very accurate . I love the controls etc. Even cooking. Only one fault. When using the steam clean function it faltered as it said that the oven was not cool enough. That was misleading as the function worked after pressing the button enough times. AEG please provide correct instruction in the oven software. I had to call an engineer and AEG said that was the third time that day. The oven is great.,Approved
"I have had this oven since mid September and am enjoying using it. Initially there was a problem fitting it under my gas hob. The top of the new oven is flat compared with the previous oven which had space for the gas fittings. This proved to be a minor problem with an adjustment to the gas fittings.  Otherwise I am impressed.
I first read the instructions and then tried to use as many functions as possible. Once familiar with these it is easy to use. I have had no difficulties and it cleans itself. So far I would recommend it.
It is stylish and modern and envied by visitors.",Approved
"am I missing something? usually washing/dryer machines have 30 min wash and 40 min dry cycles available 
as speedy options .. current cycles cotton/synthetics take too long.",Approved
This is the third Zanussi I have had and the previous two lasted a very long time. The last one I had still worked when I sold it. I bought this one because it was on a great offer. It has a lot of features although I tend to use the same few that I am happy with but it is good to have the facility to use extra rinses and short washes etc. Very happy with it.,Approved
"Quite a surprise at the speed at which this oven warms up and cooks, has many choices depending on what you are cooking and the way you want to cook it. Easy to keep clean.

"Loving this oven, it heats up quickly and all food is perfectly cooked. Found the controls really simple to use and absolutely love the food probe as it makes getting the perfect beef joint really easy.

"The fridge/freezer looks handsome and the freezer compartment is suitable for a small family: with a large middle compartment for frozen vegetables with smaller top and bottom compartments for, e.g. meat and ice cream. The upper fridge compartment is dominated by two large bins for vegetables and fruit. One bin may be OK for meat and fish if your family is fond of fresh meat (we aren't). There is really insufficient room in the door for storage of milk, cheese etc. and the egg compartment is definitely too small. As others state, the open door alarm is a waste of space. We are not using the bottle shelf but I can see this as very useful for a young family. Despite a couple of minor criticisms we like this fridge and would recommend it for a family of two adults and two young children",Approved

"Disappointed with the service team and product. The layout of the glass shelves are too close to each other, the chrome plated edging on them also are easily scratched and flimsy. Reversing the doors has been a total nightmare, we have tried twice to do it ourselves and not possible with the hinge screw not budging!! We were told that its not possible to get an engineer out unless you pay for the call out, unless its a manufacturing issue. Anyway we finally got our Retailer to pay for the call-out, the engineer showed up but said its a fault with the product and have experienced this before on this particular model. Therefore need to order the part and come back again, very frustrated this has taken almost 3 weeks and still not resolved!",Approved
"I have had the Oven for just over a month so have been unable to use all the 20 plus main functions therefore I will concentrate on what I have used to date.

This is an advanced oven with plenty of functions to support and please the experienced chef/cook whilst maintaining an easy to use approach for the less advanced or beginner cook.   

It delivers, in other words it cooks in line with expectations and has often exceeded those expectations even when you consider it’s a high calibre oven. 

Pyrolytic cleaning is essential and the 3 time settings which allow the oven to be cleaned to different levels gives amazing control over the whole process.   Who wouldn’t enjoy not having to clean their cooker!!!

We hear lots about steam for use around the house today, high calibre steam irons and mops so how is the steam aspect of this cooker. 

Another case of more than exceeds expectations as the “steam” functions keep food succulent, tasty and delicious. We may be in a digital age but this oven transforms your cooking from the “transport” café to “Orient Express” standard.

First Impressions

Wow, Sleek looking with Brushed Steel/Silver finish with digital display and touch controls with no buttons or switches, nice to look at but what about in use. You need to remember that the controls are below the display and the display is not “touch” screen.    That said no buttons or switches provides for easier cleaning as there is no need to have to clean in those awkward hard to reach areas.

The instruction manual is over 52 pages so plenty of information; perhaps too much as I initially felt overwhelmed by the number of options.  Fortunately the main cooking functions are accessible and easy to work out without having to refer to or read the manual.  Great for those who just can’t be bothered to digest manuals!

An Access (link) to a more comprehensive manual or recipe book would be useful especially for some of the more “exotic” functions.

Before Using

Setting up, there are a number of things to adhere to before using the oven for the first time, including “water hardness” which can account for using “Hard” water to prevent limescale. Fortunately I do not have to worry about that. Finally remember to “use” the oven to remove any residue before first time use.

No Chance of Burnt Dinners

Multiple timer functions for starting and stopping the cooking process work well however you need to remember to factor in the cooling time to prevent over cooking. Sliding shelf and temperature probe are also included.

Pyrolytic Function

The oven has a “self cleaning” or Pyrolytic function with 3 settings/durations, the oven goes through a “drying” stage to remove any remaining water (from Steam cooking) prior to the “burning” off the residue from the body of the cooker. The oven is locked through this process.

You need to remember to remove all shelves etc. from the oven and the display reminds you to do this. The “Grey” residue can then be wiped clean with a damp cloth with any remaining stubborn dirt requiring a bit more effort.

Tip:  When removing accessories especially the rails, place a finger next to the “socket” on the side wall which will help with rail removal and prevent the “socket” being pulled from the side wall.

The glass in the door can be removed for cleaning as this does not see the full heat during the cleaning process.

The shelves and rails are stainless steel (as opposed to “non stick”) so should be “dishwasher” safe.

True fan cooking

Bakes food on a choice of shelves and the fan moves the heat evenly around the oven at a lower temperature than during conventional cooking. I have cooked chicken and casseroles and it works in line with expectations.

Pizza Setting

Pizza is cooked (including fresh dough) produces a nice and crispy base as the heat is more intensive on the bottom. Toppings on thicker bases may become over cooked, thinner bases may be overcooked if adhere to suggested timing. A case of practice makes perfect! Delicious pizza without resorting to take out.

Frozen Foods

This cooks “convenience” foods such as chicken fillets quickly and makes them crispy on the outside. Very tasty food is produced but need to check that not overcooked.

Grilling and Turbo Grilling

Toast and bacon is cooked evenly with a nice colour in all areas of the oven.

Moist Fan Baking – Energy Saving

To prepare baked goods in tins on one shelf position in accordance with cooking tables. I used this for a sponge cake (from a mix) without referring to any tables and this produced a moist evenly bake cake. 

Dough Proving

Dough usually needs to be covered with a damp cloth/cling film otherwise it dries out during the proving process as it increases in size prior to cooking. This function uses steam to keep the air moist and prevents the surface being contaminated or damaged by the cloth. It works really well and proves at 35 Celsius which cannot be changed and is timed which can be changed.

Bread Baking

This function can be used to prepare bread and bread rolls and uses steam to keep the air moist during the process, the temperature and timing can be changed. Need to keep an eye on the process as results will vary depending on type of bread being baked.

Ciabatta bread was well cooked inside with soft dough and a crisp outside. I used the timer function on Seeded brown bread which was a bit “over” cooked as I had to leave the bread in the oven during the cool down process. This would have been perfect if removed earlier.

Overall I am very pleased with this high calibre oven and look forward to exploring the other features and continuing by adventures with Steam.",Approved

"Wow, who knew that washing machine technology had moved on so much! 
At first I didn't think I would use all of the tech but after familiarising myself with it and reading about all of the benefits I'm so glad I have! My clothes are softer and less creased and also the machine is so much quieter than any I've had before. A great design and the energy rating is fantastic. I also love how the programs are adaptable if you are short on time and need a quicker wash without losing quality. It is making a huge difference for someone like me who is time poor.",Approved
"When redoing our kitchen a couple of years ago, we bought the majority of our appliances from AEG. Recently however, we were offered a free upgrade on our oven to this Steam Oven. We had purchased a ""normal"" oven previously, not really understanding why we would need a Steam Oven, but were keen to find out the differences.

It has a lot of the same functions as our previous appliance, such as the food sensor which worked really well with our turkey last Christmas, but also has everything from ""Quarter Steam + Heat"" up to ""Full Steam"" cooking, as well as Steam cleaning in place of Pyrolytic cleaning, which is a much better idea!

The control panel is very similar to our Combination Microwave Oven, so we already had a fair idea how to use it, although annoyingly the new oven's display is a different colour, so they now look a bit odd beside each other. We did however need to read the user manual numerous times to work out the automatic recipes and to understand when we could or should use the steam functions. AEG have since directed us to the app, which has a very useful converter, changing the recipes we already use with fan cooking into heat + steam options. The roast pork we cooked with ""Quarter Heat + Steam"" was very succulent and the ""Fully Steamed"" fish was perfect. I am now going to use the oven to steam everything ready for our baby being weaned!

There are many other useful options like ""Set + Go"" for setting a more complicated heating function earlier and then using it later by pressing any button. There are also some interesting functions like Slow cooking, drying, and steam regenerating which I intend to try in the future. 

The downsides are really the extra cooking time and ""maintenance"" that's involved with steam cooking - namely the 6 minute ""Tank Emptying"" program which you have to use each time, and then the suggestion to run your oven on a normal fan setting at 150oC for 15 minutes after this, in order to dry the appliance out again. This seems quite energy inefficient to me and does put me off from using the steam option more regularly.  

All in all, a great appliance, with loads of different functions which give you lots of different cooking options to make your food taste as good as possible!",Rejected
"I have been loving cooking in my new oven. It has just so much to offer.  The food sensor has been a revelation for me, I had never used anything like this before and now I couldn't do without it. There's a vast array of settings and you can  save your favourite ones with a ""Favourite"" option. You can even set the brightness of the display to your liking.! It's all the little details that I keep discovering that makes this oven a joy to cook with",Rejected
"I am enjoying cooking with this new oven so far.  It is spacious and well lit and the food sensor is an great addition,  I'm loving the cooking precision  I have been able to obtain with it so far. Really good all rounder",Rejected
Doesn't disappoint. You can pretty much fine tune the way your roast or bake for best results. Everything I have cooked in it  this so far has been a success.,Rejected
Thanks for letting me testing ! Steam function is fab,Rejected
Great dryer. Simple to use with different drying options.,Approved
"It has so many features and settings that it was a bit overwhelming to begin with but thankfully the user manual is very clear and informative.  The sous-vide menu gives loads of options. It has 3 diffferent levels of humidity you can chose from. So far, I have found that the turbo grilling works great on roasts and the full steam setting does a really good job for the accompanying vegs. The rakes are possibly on the heavy  side but all in all this is probably the best oven we ever owned.",Rejected
"The oven looks sleek and is solidly built. It heats up in minutes and signals you with a beep to advise you the oven has reached the required temperature.  Initially, I found the oven a little daunting, it was the first time I had used a steam oven and the user manual felt overwhelming.  However, after a few test runs the oven is actually fairly easy to use and I would not be without it.  

There are many heating functions.  I tend to use the true fan, pizza setting, full steam and the humidity cooking functions the most. We eat a lot of fish so the full steam function has been brilliant for our family. I simply place the fish on a tray, cover it with herbs or spices and put it into the oven to cook.  The fish comes out so succulent and tasty. I also cook vegetables in the same way.  The pizza’s we have cooked are crisper on the bottom than what they used to be in our old oven.  The pizzas also seem to cook quicker so be careful not to burn them! 

The humidity setting is ingenious, it a combination setting of steam and heat.  There are three different humidity settings, low, medium and high. I tend to use the low setting the most.  I cook meat and casserole dishes on this setting and I have found that the meat is tender and juicy as you would expect in a slow cooker but the meat also gets brown and crispy. The first time I cooked a chicken, I was expecting an anaemic looking chicken but the skin was crispy and the meat was melt in your mouth.  

The true fan setting is what you would expect, similar to my old oven but more efficient probably owing to the newer model.  I have also used the steam regenerating function a couple of times when I have plated up left over roast dinners. This function reheated the food without drying the food up and prevented and rubbery food as you sometimes get from a microwave.

Lastly, the food sensor is great, I use it every time I cook joints of meat. It’s reassuring to be able to see the internal temperatures, especially when cooking chicken and ham joints.

Overall, I would highly recommend the oven to anyone who likes and enjoys cooking good food.",Approved
"The oven is quite modern - it heats up in minutes and clearly signals you each time it's heated up. It's easy to use which makes it even more user-friendly. 
All dishes I've tried cooking so far - meat, fish, veggie - come out deliciously! The fan is excellent! Also, it's got a sense cook option, which I've never seen in an oven before!
Highly recommended to anyone who likes cooking made easy and quick!",Approved
Thanks for letting me testing ! Defintalety user friendly,Rejected
"It has taken quite a few weeks to really get to know my new Mastery oven AEG BSE 874320M. This is a superior model to my previous oven an AEG BPS 5304001M.  I decided to try a number of programmes and compare the results I obtained with what I would have achieved with my old oven.
This oven comes with a comprehensive range of programmes. It has all the basic programmes that my old AEG oven has for example grill, defrost, convection cooking with fan, without fan etc., but it also has a subset of special programmes for example, for proving dough in bread making and providing the water trough is filled, steam is produced automatically in the bread making programme, giving your loaf a professional crispy finish.  In addition there are a number of assisted cooking programmes for example for baking fresh pizza.  In these programmes the temperature of the oven and length of cooking are preset.  My pizza turned out crispy using the assisted cooking programme.  Cooking pizza in exactly the same way in the old oven does not achieve the same result.  In the case of the old oven the dough was a lot softer on the bottom, the food critics (my family) tell me they like the new pizza better.
The oven comes with a fast heat up option unlike my old AEG oven which did not have this facility.  This is something which I find I cannot now do without.  I have had this facility with previous ovens. The mastery oven has a very fast fast heat up indeed, the oven temperature increases from 16C to 180C in less than ten minutes.
Like my old AEG oven this oven has pyrolytic cleaning.  This oven’s programmes are even better.  A little message appears when I turn it on now inviting me to decide whether to clean the oven or not, and this is just after a month.  There are 3 cleaning programmes, the long one (3 hours and best done on a winter’s day as the kitchen can get quite warm) and two shorter programmes for lightly soiled ovens.  It is reassuring that the door remains locked while these programmes are on, so there is no danger accidentally opening the door too soon. It is wonderful to just wipe away the grime with a damp cloth, so easy and definitely no scrubbing!
The timer feature is improved too, there are options for extending the cooking time and keeping the food warm at the end of the programme.  I particularly like this flexibility. It maintains an end to the cooking process.  This is important if you get distracted as it prevents food from burning/spoiling.
There are two programmes specifically concerned with bread making.  The first very useful programme is for proving the dough.  The second programme uses the steam facility.  When I made a loaf of bread recently the display invited me to fill up the water tank, and then after a number of cups of water it instructed me to stop filling.  After about 20 mins my loaf was beautifully golden and I decided to stop the programme, I soon realised that this was a mistake as the bottom of the loaf felt soggy, I put the loaf back in the oven and gave it the full cooking time as per the special programme.  The loaf was baked to perfection.  The best loaf I have ever made.
The temperature sensor is particularly clever.  It is important to set the right core temperature and oven temperature.   I recently cooked rack of pork.  I set the core temperature to 80C, and the oven temperature to 200C using the true fan cooking setting, then after a little while the oven worked out the length of time needed for roasting.  This enabled me to add the vegetables to the roasting pan half an hour before the end of cooking time so that both meat and vegetables were ready at the same time!
Recently I tried making meringue.  I used true fan cooking at 80C and set the timer for 3hours.  The meringue was very crisp.  My food critics said it was too crisp and that they prefer a bit of gooiness in the middle.  I thought it was fine but then I am biased.
I have used the plate warming programme.  This is great for keeping food warm, for example a ready meal that is being cooked in the microwave would go cold quickly unless the plates were warmed.  The regenerating programme is fantastic for warming up cold dinners.  
Two weeks ago I made Christmas pudding using the steam oven.  I only partly cooked it so that it can be finished on Christmas day.  I am looking forward to a perfectly cooked turkey using the food sensor cooking facility
Summing up my experience of this oven.  It is extremely easy to use and very versatile. It makes you wonder how you ever managed without the extra features.",Approved

Thanks for letting me testing ! Very good material and tasty,Rejected
"We have this oven in our mums house, it's a bit of a hub for us all and it has been used by 3 generations and they all love it, it's been used from meals for one right through to family dinners catering for around 20 and it has  performed faultlessly.
One of the great things about it is it's complex but not complicated so our 70 year mum got on with it straight away.
The function wheel and display are very intuitive.
The steam function is a revelation, producing a great crusts on bread and succulent roasts.
We've had pyrolytic ovens for as long as I can remember and this one is as good as any we've had making oven cleaning a simple task, once you've had one you'll never go back.
Quite simply a great oven that you can feel the quality and it looks fab with its clean lines.",Approved
"My bread is the best with this oven. The steam function is simple to use and gives a crust like no other.  Additionally, i can put in more than one at a time without one being burnt and the other uncooked.",Rejected
"Having upgraded to this newer model we are so pleased with the outcome. Although very similar in function there are small improvements that make the upgrade well worthwhile. Firstly, the touch screen function (which only worked intermittently on the previous model) has been replaced with a control wheel that works superbly. No more drying hands and wiping screens whilst furiously trying to set a timer or choose a function. Simply spin the wheel! Although at first the wheel can seem sensitive, you soon get used to this and I would never go back to the touch screen. AEG have also improved the timer function with a 'warning beep' going off 1-2 minutes prior to the actual timer. Really handy for preparing the bench or table ready for your meal. The 'Assisted Cooking' function been most useful and is surprisingly accurate -we have now perfected the lemon drizzle cake using the sponge cake pre-setting. With so many more useful function, I would definitely recommend.",Approved
"When we were offered an upgrade on our existing AEG BP320300K pyrolytic oven, we were sceptical that there could be much that could be improved - the old oven did a great job cooking the types of food we like to cook.  We were disappointed with the cleaning pyrolytic cleaning function, not because it didn’t work - it did, and quite well - but because it was very noisy, made the kitchen smell slightly odd due to the fumes and it always seemed to make the oven door handle work loose.  Every time we used the pyrolytic function we ended up having to take the door apart in order to tighten the screws so that the handle wouldn’t fall off.  And don’t get me started on the cost of electricity to run the oven for 60-90 minutes at such a high temperature...

We were therefore most keen to try out this new oven which has a nifty steam cleaning function.  Before I read the manual, I thought the steam was only for cleaning but it turns out it can do a lot more than that.  Our first major cooking attempt was a leg of lamb, and we tried out both the preprogrammed lamb roast/steam cooking function and the temperature probe - another feature we didn’t have on the old oven.  We were delighted with the results - the lamb was beautifully succulent and cooked to our liking.  The probe gave us a estimated end time, although the estimate wasn’t particularly accurate to begin with, the lamb cooking much more quickly than the probe originally suggested.  Since then we have made most of our favourites, from lasagne to various cakes, all with great results. Our previous oven didn’t bake as evenly as this one so cake baking is a lot more consistent with the new one.

Comparing other functions of the oven with the old one - the new display and program selection is much clearer, the LCD display is much more modern-looking than the old red LED display and is, with one exception, very much easier to use.  So the one program we had trouble with was, ironically, the one we wanted to test most - cleaning.  Whenever we selected “yes” when asked if we wanted to start the cleaning function, it told us that the cleaning could only be carried out with a cold oven and to leave the door open and try again later.  After we had left the door open all night and found we were still being told that, apparently, the oven was too hot, I contacted the supplier.  It turned out that this was meant to be a suggestion and wasn’t intended to imply we couldn’t continue, and that we should just push the circular select button.  That turned out to be the case, and the technical department agreed with me that the message was less than helpful.  Hopefully this message will be changed in future.

So, overall, we are very happy with the new oven - I would definitely keep this one if we were offered the old one back.  I love the steam cleaning (once we worked out how to use it) and the temperature probe.  I’m looking forward to trying out some of the other steam programmes in the future.",Approved
"So you can forgive me for thinking things can be over engineered and appliances solves problem that i didn't really have in the first place. But ""auto cook"", i like to think i make a mean Sunday roast, but well done meat, is not the done thing anymore and my hipster sons, mock my ""over cooked"" beef, so with this new oven i tried the ""auto cook"" to get medium. last Sunday they were shocked!

We recently had this cooker installed in our small cottage. We would not normally have opted for a freestanding appliance but had no option as the cottage does not have a fitted kitchen. We shopped around and found this smart looking appliance. We particularly wanted an induction hob which is not that easy to find in the freestanding range. The double oven feature provides sufficient capacity in the top oven to cook for just two people whereas the main oven allows cooking for larger parties.  We particularly like the fact that we do not need to set a self cleaning programme as the oven self cleans when it reaches a certain temperature. The oven has  a very large baking tray which we like.The controls are easy to handle and doors feel solid. Bottom oven door opens sideways giving unrestricted access. My only slightly negative comment would be that I think it should be made more obvious in the instructions that the main oven will only work if the clock is set. We had had a power cut and could not work out why the main oven was no longer working whereas the top oven did. Reading through the instructions again we remembered that we needed to set or reset the clock in order to make the main oven work. We think this cooker is good value for money.,Approved

Good performance with multiple cooking modes which came as an unexpected bonus when replacing our old AEG double oven. The only drawback is the difficult to read dials.

"I have had the cordless vacuum for a few weeks and love it. It's powerful and very easy to use, it's head is very flexible and reacts with ease. It's great for getting under furniture and moves with ease from carpet to hard floor. The small handheld vacuum is great for stairs and furniture. The charge lasts long enough to do the whole house.

The energy rating in store claimed an energy consumption of nearly 50% of other machines. In reality it uses as much as our previous model that was seven years old. The audible cycle end bleeper is extremely difficult to hear if you are more than 10 feet away. Other than that it appears to be working OK (so far).,Approved
This product replaced a Siemans washer dryer which developed problems after 3 years which needed repairs costing £900 replacement was a no brainer. Have bought AEG before so this washing machine was easy to choose as a replacement.,Approved
Very happy with oven works good cooks good looks really nice in kitchen.its good that both ovens do almost the same cooking possibilities with the bottom oven having fan,Approved
Great quality as you would expect from AEG and with the added bonus of being able to match all your other kitchen appliances to this range.,Approved
"good ovens and controls, cooks accurately, a pleasure to use",Approved
So far so good. Temperature acurate and bakes evenly.,Approved
Thanks for letting me testing ! Very efficient and safe,Rejected
"Simple and easy to use, although the front load door is a little heavy and clunky.",Approved
Best oven I have had in a very long time .... Love all the features. I haven't used everything yet but the dishes I have cooked have cooked very well and the oven is really easy to clean,Approved
"I do not usually get exited over kitchen appliances, or write reviews, but this oven deserves a mention. Firstly I was always under the impression that 200c in a fan oven was just that, but all I can say is that our last oven was shelf placeme sensetive and did not cook evenly, but this is completely the opposite, cooks evenly and just seems more controlable (not so time critcal) as have not burt a thing yet, even if exeeding cooking time by a few mins. Also heat up times are very good, about 10 mins to get to 200c in lower (larger) oven and about 7 mins in the upper oven. This brings me on to the upper oven - just brilliant, a fully feature Second fan oven for when only one shelf is required. Also the lower oven has a second grill, great if you run a B n B and do a lot uf full english breakfasts.
 If you are used to turning a knob for temperature and another knob to select program, the controls on this may appear a bit daunting at first, but five minuites with the manual and we had it cracked. The user interface is actually well thought out with the most common (for us anyway) setting of fan cooking apearing secondi in the list (the first being to turn on the light) so you do not have to scroll down through all the settings to find it.
 The only feature I would like to see, and it was apparent from the first time using the oven was that when you turn the oven on to pre heat (as most cooking requires a preheated oven) a count up timer starts, well I would really like to see a reset feature so that I could start the timer (if required) when I put the food in.",Approved
"love the look of this modern off the floor oven. Superb in use, having not used electric for a while was a bit dubious but have been very impressed with this over when cooking, grill is excellent as well.",Approved
"This is the worst oven I have ever had.
I had for just over a year when it started to switch itself off during cooking 
Really really annoying and given the price it cost this is absolutely disgraceful",Approved
"This oven came as standard with a new property and is totally useless as far as I am concerned.   I am only 5ft 11ins  and, not only are all the knobs way above my head, having the temperature settings printed around the knob means the only way I can set the oven is to stand on a step stool which, at almost 71 years of age is not a good option.    I am hoping the builders will take pity on me and change the oven for one I can operate whilst just standing on the floor.",Approved
Everything going as stated .Its quick and easy to control. Let's give it some time,Approved
"I wanted a double oven that gave me flexibility with the size of the ovens and the range of functions available. 
The only downside found so far is when I open the grill the steam billows out and steams up my glasses!",Approved
"Double fan oven! Pizza function which is also great for Yorkshire pudding) Efficient - well insulated; keeps its heat well. Nice clean button free touch control which is easy to master.
Great oven.",Approved
"Top ovn is perfect for small casserole s etc, also for grilling. Bottom oven has several functions, the fan oven heats efficiently, 3 shelves which is a luxury after my single oven. Love it",Approved
Bought this to replace a cooker that was nearly 20 years old. This is our first induction cooker and the hob is excellent. The speed of heating is most welcome and the hob is easy to clean. There are no buttons to trap spillages and it looks wonderful.,Approved
Thanks for letting me testing ! So easy to use - instantly responsive,Rejected
"works well, ticks all boxes, only thing i found strange was that if the clock is not programmed the bottom oven does not work ... very strange",Approved
"I like these ovens, they hold the temperature and are straight forward and easy to use. My only complaint is that they are slightly too high to see where the setting is. I'm not short but they are slightly too high.",Approved
"Only had this about a month, would recommend to anyone. Don't even notice when the machine is on, very quiet. Many options to select from that covers all of my requirements. Not a cheap product but you pay for what you get which is very good quality",Approved
"I bought this for my wife as valentine gift this year and she is really happy for it.
We found the product easy to use and looks efficient and great.",Rejected
We have had this fridge over a year with no issues whatsoever. It is located in the main kitchen area and is very quiet compared to other fridges we have had. It has a great layout and easily copes with our home of 4 adults. Highly recommend.,Approved
"A new addition to a new kitchen with matching freezer, which performs as well as it looks. 
Favourite things - the light that comes on gradually as you open the door, the large clear drawers....oh, and the space!",Approved
Good idea to have the two fan ovens in the same unit. Build quality seems good but the temperature controls are dubious on our oven. for a £900 oven you would expect that the digital temperatures would have a tolerance of approx 10 % or less but ours is more like 15 to 20 %.  Top oven the smaller of the two is cooler by about 15%  and the bottom is hotter by about 20%. Fault has been called in and I will update the review in due course.,Approved
Omg I knew induction were good but this job is so easy to use and responds amazingly.,Approved
"I called my local electrical shop (customer for 30 years) as my Miele wm was about to die after 15 years of hard use. They promised me an all singing and all dancing machine on a medium budget! They were spot on! It does more than my old top of the range Miele, easy to program my 4 adult kids love it! And so do I! Thank you Anglian Electrics and AWG!",Rejected
Not too sure how it fully works yet so far but I love the way it looks and it's been effective on basic settings like defrost which has been a lot better than in my microwave and just as easy and quick to start. The rakes are a little heavier than the ones on my previous oven but they slide in smoothly so it's not too much of a problem.,Rejected

This washing machine is simple to use. Excellent wash cycles and clean results. Would recommend to other users.,Approved
"Well designed quality double oven. The instructions could be more comprehensive, but we have now mastered the controls and both ovens, which can be used at the same time, if required, cook everything well.",Approved
"Also, why can I not use the 1600 spin on the 30 degree quick wash cycle, after using this setting I then have to use the spin setting on 1600 which takes 12 minutes. After the never ending 60 degree wash the bed linen is exceedingly creased. The 'Quick' and 'Super Quick' wash is not available.",Approved

"We have had the repair company out three times within the two year warranty period. AEG are the hardest company to contact for follow up care. Their care is virtually non-existent, they seem to think on going repairs are acceptable. They are not. It is obvious that the fridge/freezer we purchased is not fit for purpose. They are still refusing to replace it, however, we will not let this go and we shall pursue this through the courts if necessary.",Rejected

The main problem we have are that the settings are on the knobs and not the cooker. Therefore you cannot see then unless you are over 6 foot tall. I have had to resort to putting coloured dots on the cooker which for a £600 product is unacceptable.,Rejected

"I had this dishwasher fitted just before Christmas as part of a new fitted kitchen and agree with previous reviewer, this is the worst dishwasher I've ever had.
The dishes are still wet when they come out, I've never had this with a dishwasher before.
Also, on several occasions dishes have been left with food stains on - not just the odd little bit but looking as though they havent been touched by water at all. For instance, last night I used a dish to warm some beans in the microwave to go with a baked potato. The dish went into the dishwasher straight away but when I took it out this morning, the bean juice was still there but now dried on. I do rinse dishes briefly before putting into the machine but if I have to fully wash them first, then it defeats the object of purchasing a dishwasher.
I am not doing anything differently with this machine than with my previous Bosch machines but getting very inferior results.",Approved
"Excellent internal size. Deep shelves, which allow you to store large items and plenty of room in the door shelves for tall items as well as small jars.

"In making this model of the AEG Favorit dishwasher, in my opinion, AEG have taken a great product and done their best to ruin it. This is the 5th Favorit we have had and the others have all been super so we didn't hesitate to buy another but I'm beginning to wish we hadn't.

What's wrong with it –

• I find it doesn't wash very well. On every programme except the highest tea stains are still left in mugs, stains on cutlery, bits on bowls. The normal 60 degree programme on our last model was fine for everything and this one is extremely weak. The programme is also about half an hour longer than the old Favorit and it's still only just doing the job.
• In my experience it doesn't rinse or dry very well. Particularly on the inside of non-stick pans water droplets are often left. A glass chopping board came out covered in smears.
• The basket configurations have been changed, I presume to fit in more cups and saucers. Who uses a lot of cups and saucers everyday? Not us. We use a lot of mugs and large glasses and I cannot get these to fit in well. There used to be three whole lines available from front to back to hold these items slightly at a tilt. Now I have to try and cram them in the saucer racks and they often fall sideways and are not held at the correct angle so that water is caught on the top.
• The door closure is just a pull instead of a catch which you have to use quite a lot of force to get open and I find this difficult.
• The underside of the plastic above the door is very sharp and rough and I have grazed my hand on it causing injury.
• The programme defaults every time to the ""eco"" option AEG think you should be using. I then have to cycle several times through back to the most intense option every wash because in my experience the Eco programme doesn't wash properly.
• There is a strip at the front of the machine underneath where the door closes inwards that catches all manner of gunk and debris.
• The cutlery basket configuration has changed and less cutlery can be fitted in more awkwardly.
• The baskets are really wobbly and feel flimsy to me and the bottom one has a decided list to the rear and will slide back into the machine at any opportunity. There's also a prong missing on the plate run on the right hand side of the bottom basket so the plates won't stack up evenly.

There is one thing that's better about this model –

• They have got rid of the internal light.

I suggest AEG should employ someone who actually uses a dishwasher for normal loads of crockery to work with their design engineers. I really don't know how I'm supposed to fit my crockery in to this new configuration.",Rejected

"We had a 20 year old OKO dishwasher with mechanical timer - this was excellent, solidly built, easy to repair (3 times by me) and with a separate rinse cycle so that you didn't have to wash until a load had built up. Eventually the mantenance buit up and we decided to replace it. Although an electronics engineer I ma not a fan of computer controlled devices - they are too inflexible and repairs can be expensive. We decided to go for an AEG one again and thois seemed a suitable choice. It was delivered promptly but when I installed it the door side scraped on the metalwork and wouldn't close until I levered it back into position. The build is extremely light, so much so that unless you jerk the door quite hard, the machine slides on the floor instead of opening. Internally, it is very dark and difficult to see for cleaning. All of these we can cope with or learn to accept. BUT. There is no separate rinse and hold cycle. I have to bodge round this by starting a cycle that has a pre-rinse, resetting it, starting again to pump out, and resetting again. The wash cycles take a ridiculously long time - up to 4 hours. Yes, it seems to wash OK - so did the old one. The short wash has no pre-rinse and seems a waste of time and water.
We've got it now, and have to live with it, but I am dissappointed that (as is becoming usual) modern design is worse than that of 20 years ago. This is supposedly a premium product at quite a high price. I hope is lasts better than the AEG washing machine we bought a three years ago that ran its unrepairable bearings (in a 2-pensioner house with no nappies) just before the guarantee ran out, but seems to be OK now.",Rejected

"I have recently upgraded to the AEG FSB41600 built in dishwasher and what I instantly liked about this dishwasher was the.

Advanced sensors that automatically adjust the washing time , temperature, and water usage depending on how dirty your pots pans plates cutlery are therefore customising the wash cycles to get the best results each time.

 

It also has what AEG calls their new Airdry technology, this allows you to maximise the drying performance with natural air flow, when the cycle is in the last stage and the dishes are done the door will self open 10cm enabling the dishes to dry naturally which also reduces energy costs.

 

This energy saving smart dishwasher also has a delay start function which lets you preset a programme at your convenience .

 

The AEG, FSB41600 built in dishwasher is exceptional with great energy saving benefits and another environmentally friendly appliance from AEG.",Rejected
Wrote a review previously after AEG emailed me but failed to put up review. Bought this unit to replace a Bosch.  Tried all functions and plates still need recleaning.

"We are very pleased with this dishwasher. We have noticed a significant improvement in comparison with our old machine, super sparkling dishes! There is plenty of space inside and it is easy to raise or lower the top shelf if needed. The fact that the door pops open for the final drying phase is clever and means that the dishwasher and contents get an airing if you are out for the day or longer. The door is a little stiff but that’s not a big deal. All in all we think it is a very effective dishwasher that is easy to use, a good buy.",Approved

"Just had a new kitchen and chose the mid range dishwasher offered by the suppliers, which happened to be this one. Have had dishwashers since 1985 and had about 6 in that time and this is the worst! It's the design that is poor.  You just cannot stand glasses or mugs properly. There isn't enough width and they constantly fall over unless you stack the whole rack.  Because of the poor design you can only get a certain number in leaving a gap which you can't fill and so they all tip over again. A nightmare!  Hard to explain, but nothing fits properly on that top rack . The incline is wrong, too narrow etc etc.. The bottom rack for plates etc is better except the cutlery rack is useless and have already removed the top as I have the  plastic risers on the top rack.  Do not buy! There are much better designed dishwashers around! I didn't even realise how long it took as I just set it and leave! Useless! Only had it a week and I hate it!",Approved
"I've not had this long. Purchased mainly due to my previous AEG experience plus Which? review. So far has performed very well. Cleans beautifully & gently. No tangles or lost socks! Fast spin, excellent, resulting in less dryer time. Hopefully this plus the efficiency rating should prove economical. Big plus is that it is so quiet that I have to remember to go to the laundry room to empty it! Yes! It does better than it says on the tin.",Approved

"Unfortunately at less than 6 months some issues with heating. Now into third week without dishwasher and waiting another visit from a service tech.

Excellent dishwasher cleans brilliantly everytime so far compared to other dishwashers we've had. Only downside there is no short wash.,Approved
Great feature whereby the door opens after cycle. Would prefer more cycles like my old dishwasher. Not sure about the rack as when I open the door it’s on a slant and the rack slopes back inside the dishwasher but of a pain when loading many dishes. Doesn’t feel as sturdy as my old Bosch dishwasher but still nice to have a new up to date dishwasher. Very basic functions,Approved
I agree with the review from Jennifer.  I am extremely disappointed as this was in my brand new home and it’s the worst product in my kitchen. Why would you put a delay function on something that takes so long.  I miss my previous dishwasher with its 30 and 50 minute wash programs and adjustable fold down plate stackers!,Approved

"We have just replaced our old AEG dishwasher with this one, and wish we hadn't bothered.
Firstly, 3 hours for a programme is ridiculous.
Energy saving ??.....yeah right !!
It sits there doing nothing for half the programme.
Besides that, if you lead a busy lifestyle like we do, and you sometimes cant empty the dishwasher until the following morning, then forget it.
If you leave it too long, after ANY cycle, when you come to take the pots out, they are covered in condensation and need to be dried.
Also, the bottom basket is a shambles.
Slide the bottom basket out to load it up, and it just slides straight back in. It will NOT stay out, so you either keep sliding it out to load it, or get someone to hold it for you, its terrible.
So, If you want a new dishwasher, and being an AEG fan or not..I do NOT recommend this one.

On the whole a great product. Plenty of room for storing all that is necessary and a good sized freezer box too. Plenty if room for all the bottles and jars I like to store in the fridge. My only minus comment is that although the crisper/vegetable box is roomy it would be useful to have a height divider rather than having to pile the contents on top of one another,Approved
"This dishwasher was offered as a replacement for another AEG model that could not be mended. It was chosen because the dimensions fitted that of the previous model in the integrated kitchen. I am finding it difficult to cite anything positive about model FSK31600Z. The upper basket is a terrible design, impossible to stack tumblers let alone mugs and kitchen utensils. The runners on the lower basket are flimsy and easily come out of their restrainers. The cutlery basket is a joke, so much so that we are using the basket from the old model. The shortest cycle, excluding a prewash of 14 minutes, is the “Normal” one which takes 130 to 140 minutes. The “Eco wash” takes a staggering 222 minutes and the 70deg  155 to 170 minutes. Despite adjusting the rinse aid settings to that of our local water, glass tumblers are now frosted and we wash by hand. Overall the model is very poor and if we had our choice again, we would not choose model FSK31600Z.",Approved

It is absolutely ridiculous that the fastest programme is 130-140 minutes long - over 2 hours!!! When powered off it returns to the default ECO marathan programme that lasts a whopping 222 minutes. Sod the environment - I want clean dishes. The upper basket is poorly designed and glasses and mugs of all shapes and sizes fall over. Loading the dishwasher feels like I am playing a twisted version of Jenga.,Approved
"We got this built into our new kitchen as a backup for our AEG fridge freezer, having been so impressed by it. This built-in larder fridge benefits from the same good design and build quality and is quiet in operation. Only slight disappointment is that, although both appliances are 600mm wide, the shelves and fittings are not interchangeable (would love to be able to fit the wine rack which came with the big fridge freezer into the little fridge).",Approved
The quality was a little disappointing. The catch could break at any minute by the feel of it. Glasses don’t fit into the upper tray that well,Approved
"This is the worst brand new aplpliance I have ever bought and I am particularly frustrated as it forms part of a brand new kitchen. It can not accommodate a standard Denby White dinner plate - nothing fancy just the same dinner plates we have had for the last 15 years and now I have to complete the Krypton factor every night to try and find the best location/ angle so the grey sprayer inside the machine doesn't continually hit and create a thud every 3 secs as it spins.
 Ofcourse there is no option to change the height setting of the trays. None of my cutlery fits through the holes of the lid of the cutlery holder so the lid had to be swiftly discarded. Every 'load up' requires a degree in trying to work out what could fit where?  as nothing - not a single glass or cup fits naturally as the space is too narrow or unsupported. As for saucepans and baking trays that's where the rubber gloves come in - you have to wash all those by hand because once two of those go in the bottom shelf it's game over- all the space has gone! There is nothing to keep the bottom shelf wheels at bay - given half a chance I get the impression it would run off into the sunset as it is sick of the lack of space and logic of how it is all suppose to be set out too!. 13 piece setting seriously? I struggle to get 6 in! Oh and if one more person suggests that it's smaller because it's integrated- I swear I will swing for them - sorry I don't want to advertise my appliances to everyone in my kitchen so do I have to suddenly turn into the 'Borrowers' and eat off a saucer?? Also please do not be fooled by the eco wash when what it means is it will take 1hr30mins longer for the cycle to finish to allow the air to dry it??? It drys quicker on my draining board!! I want a dishwasher to wash the dishes well first time round not have to reload them several times because the eco wash was not up to the job and the irony is it's had to go on twice to do the work the first wash missed!! 
Reality is the excitement is all held in a light that shines on the floor - red for dishwasher running and green to let you know it's ready to be unloaded- this is the only USP and worth 1 star!",Rejected

"This dishwasher replaced an older AEG that was over 5 years old...I'm really impressed with how much more stuff I can fit into it! The washing results are brilliant, in my old model I seemed to get a few bits out that weren't cleaned properly but this cleans everything perfectly. I use a lot of Tupperware/plastic items and they would normally come out of the dishwasher damp, but with this new dishwasher they come out perfectly dry. Love it!!",Approved
"Bought this fridge/freezer to replace a free standing model, since installation the product has performed well with no issues. We required a 50/50 split fridge/freezer which are not that common in the market, the temperatures within the unit have stayed consistent and it runs quietly which was a major factor in our decision to purchase the product.",Approved

Well done AEG!",Approved
A good reliable machine but the instructions could be clearer.,Approved
Our brand new dishwasher completed one thirty minute cycle and simply stalled mud-cycle there after. The engineEr says its an electrical fault requiring a new part installed. All after using the machine just once,Approved
"This is such a beautiful product. Modern yet sleek design and so simple to use and maintain.

The only gripe is in relation to build quality. I had to return my first one at 12 days old and only used to make 9 perfect tasting coffee's the product began to leak water from the base whenever the compressor engaged during operation.",Approved

Great coffee every time, no mess easy to use and clean

"The size was what attracted me initially, however I am really impressed with the range of programmes. The machine is unobtrusive and quiet in my open plan house.",Approved
"I wish I'd replaced our dryer sooner this is so much better, quicker and quieter. Very good build quality, very easy to install and use. Highly recommended",Approved
"Looks good, easy to operate. Like the fact that the buttons light up when in use which stops my elderly mother living on accidentaly.",Approved
"Overall we are pleased with the way the dishwasher operates although we have some points that we would like to raise :
the layout of the ""drawers"" does not allow for such easy stacking of dishes as our previous dishwasher,
the door is very stiff and is not easy to open, 
the most annoying thing is that the machine can't be set to a particular wash setting - it always moves on to the next setting in the sequence after a wash has been completed.",Approved
This is a good solid dishwasher with a well thought out interior. The only fault really being I wasn't that impressed with the mechanism that jacks the back of the machine up.,Approved
Really quiet machine doing the job great recommended to everyone,Approved

"Great machine, very happy with technology and wash",Approved
"This was purchased to replace a smaller A Modo Mio which started to leak badly after 9 months use, as had a previous Modo Mio machine I owned. So far I am very pleased with this new and slightly larger machine with attached frother. It makes great expresso and cappuccino, plus others, and is simple to use. I was a little hesitant to purchase another AEG Lavazza machine after previous experiences but the quality of the coffee is good. I just hope this one does not start leaking after a few months!!",Approved
Great design and easy to set. Best feature is its quietness.,Rejected
"So far I am very pleased with this dishwasher which is much quieter than my previous machine. I like the 30 minute cycle for dishes which are not too dirty. 

I was not pleased with the joining/fill-in strip for the front of the machine which was of very poor quality (plastic painted silver).",Approved
Unfortunately am dissapointed. 1. Laundry comes out not completly dry. 2. The entire bathroom is filled with heat and moist. No tube to connect to it so steam could get out of the window and not inside the bathroom,Approved

"Cleans amazingly on every wash setting.  Very quiet. The only design aspect is the tough catch to open and close the door, which is quite hard and not a smooth close.",Approved
"Machine produces very good cleaning results and is extremely quiet in operation. Very slight niggle is that the door has to be pushed firmly down to stay fully lowered for loading lower basket, but this is a very minor issue. Delighted with the  machine overall.",Rejected

"I have had the AEG FSS62800P fully integrated dishwasher for several weeks now and given it a pretty good workout with all of the washing up generated from the cooking and baking we do as a family.

As with anything new, the kids were very keen to check the dishwasher out.  They were very impressed with the way that the bottom basket pulls forward and lifts up for easy loading and unloading – something anyone with a bad back will appreciate not having to repeatedly bend to get the low down pans and dishes.  A finishing nice touch is the soft-closing action as the basket slides back into it’s home position so everything doesn't bang.

Use wise, it’s easy to split the load between the 3 baskets (the top one is a dedicated cutlery tray), set one of the 6 programmes and forget about it till the morning.  While it’s working the machine is VERY quiet – it’s only the red light that shines on the floor that let’s you know all is well.

So - How well it washes. Generally we use the autosence programme and everything comes out clean and dry.  This is probably down to the 3 rotating spray arms the bottom one which also has an extra satellite to give even better spray coverage.  At the end of the cycle and when the contents have cooled the door automatically opens about 10cm to complete the drying process.  This works really well and means that it’s quick and easy to unload the washer in the morning.

Running costs - The machine is rated as A++, and the energy label says that on Eco programme the machine will use 262kWh over the year.  On my British Gas tariff that’s about £33 – hardly enough to make the smart meter twitch in daily use.

Finally – Installation.  The installer liked this machine (one he’d got his head around the installation pictograms).  It fit’s into a standard 60cm cabinet space and was easy to level.  The furniture door clips on and slides as the door opens – this means that the plinth didn’t need to be cut which is usually the case in his experience.

So what could be improved?  Very little.  The middle basket does not softclose or snap home like the bottom one and the washer is not supplied with a spray head to replace the middle basket if you wanted to clean particularly large items.  That said the middle tray has two height options and is really easy to change between the two.

To recap - As a single working dad to 3 girls of school age who love to make (mess!) and bake in our new AEG oven, I wanted a machine that would swallow the washing up with ease, is simple and economic to use, quiet so I can run it in the evening and have a good warranty.  This AEG machine with it’s 2 year warranty more than fits my criteria which is why I give it top marks.",Approved
"I've been using this dishwasher for a couple of weeks now and I have to say I love it. For me, the best features are the large pull-out cutlery tray (no bending down and everything is thoroughly cleaned) and the comfort lift feature (so simple yet really makes a difference to your everyday life!). I seem to be able to fit a lot more in to this dishwasher than my last one, and everything has come out sparkling so far, even really encrusted ovenware. It's super quiet, so luckily there is a great floor beam feature to let you know it's on!! A pleasure to use, they seem to have thought of everything.",Approved
"The coffee it makes is second to none, but the the frothing side of the machine is starting to be temperamental and not work till you tamper with it.
The coffee pods don’t fall down when you lift the lever up ( which is no bother) some people it might be. 
I love this machine and compared to other machines I’ve had it is the best so far",Approved
"I have had numerous dishwashers over the years, here and abroad. This model is by far the best. It is so quiet in operation I have even checked to see if I turned it on! I find the 30 minute programme is adequate for daily use, only using the longer programmes if food has had a chance to really dry on or if I cooked a big roast dinner for example. This saves so much electricity.
I have had an AEG tumble drier for 21 years. It was bought abroad, shipped back to England and has survived 7 moves since! It's still going strong despite usage for a family of 5 and pets! I feel this brand builds appliances to last, unlike many other 'throw aways' which waste our time and money and do nothing for the environment.",Approved
"Great piece of equipment, washes great every time, dish washer and oven grill working fine",Approved
"I purchased this tumble dryer to replace an old AEG tumble dryer. The dryer dries brilliantly. The water tank and fluff filter are easy to empty too. The controls are easy to operate and the sensor drying is great, It was delivered by two extremely helpful delivery men too.",Approved
"This dishwasher has many excellent features but the best is the 'Comfort Lift' function. The lower basket pulls out and up, and locks in place level with the middle basket. It lifts easily even when full of dishes, pots and pans.  It is also easy to return to the original position.  This means less bending to empty and fill it. 

There are clever grips to secure the stems of delicate wine glasses to stop them moving around. The middle basket has two height setting, to accommodate taller items in the lower basket or the middle basket. The upper basket is just for cutlery and smaller utensils, where they can all be placed separately, to ensure they are all properly cleaned. A bit fiddly at first but now not a problem and far better than the previous way of standing cutlery upright in a basket. 

The controls are located on top of the door, and are easy to follow, there is a bright clear LED display to show what programme has been selected. All programmes are easy to use and the results are excellent.. This dishwasher operates very quietly but you know when it is on as it shines a red light onto the floor under the door.  This turns green when the programme has finished.  When the dishwasher has cooled enough, the door opens automatically to allow air in to finish the drying process which is very useful too. 

Everything we have put in this dishwasher so far has come out sparkling clean and well dried.  Better still, it is simple to use. This is without doubt the best dishwasher we have ever owned and from the performance so far, we are very pleased with it.",Approved
"The machine is good size, and the new cutlery tray means much more room in the lower basket. Using the  tray meant a bit of a rethink about loading the cutlery, but we now have a good method. This means better stacking of larger plates and pots. The upper basket has a useful height adjustment too, further enhancing the flexibility for loading awkwardly shaped items. The machine is very quiet, which is important to me. The sole quibble I have with the design is that the door appears to be a bit lightweight.",Approved
Machine arrived and initial functioned satisfactorily. Then started to leak from the front door area. Design could be improved by not having the power switch in a different place to the controls,Approved
I’m so pleased with this dishwasher. It’s user friendly and functional. For something you use everyday it’s worth spending the extra money,Approved

"Bought washing mashine 3 weeks ago and still delighted. With three kids all in sport programming the cycles and choosing what fits best in my routine at that moment is a discovery for me. Shortening washing time, changing temperature, washing only 2 kg of laundry when neccessary, different spins with different temperatures...definitely makes a difference to me. Generaly, we got more space in the bathroom and design wise I like that cool, simple, straight but still innovative and functional German design. Good choice and still smiling!",Approved

"The coffee produced is, for me, better than Nespresso. 

But the AEG machine design lags. The Magimix Pixie is simpler. Examples?

- the Pixie's plastics are more robust.
- the AEG water tank has a lid you have to remove and is a bit fiddly to replace. The Pixie's top is on a reliable hinge and takes no thought.
- the Pixie's cup holder comes out in one piece, without any connectors to worry about. The AEG cup holder is loosely attached to the drip tank.
- the cup holder is fractionally too small to comfortably hold a larger cup. The Pixie cup holder could be lifted on a hinge out of the way.
- the milk container is fiddly to fit. The Magimix Aerocino is much more robust and easier to clean.
- every third or fourth time of filling the water tank slowly leaks over the counter and onto the floor. I keep checking what I'm doing but have not managed to reliably overcome the issue. the Pixie connection from the tank to the machine was 100% reliable.",Approved

The fridge has good features such a holiday mode and so on. However when you open and close the fridge and go back to put something back in the suction is so strong the whole fridge moves forward and difficult to open and to top it off the fridge doesnt have a stopper to stop the wheels from moving forward. Also the fan was super loud and engineer came out to look at it. The fridge door swings back and smashes into the kitchen cuboard behind. Big Mistake.,Approved
"Good features are that the wash performance is great, it uses air drying by opening the door to ensure that your plastics are dry, it has a removable cutlery tray, projects a countdown timer on the floor for the current program and it has a large light inside. 

Bad points are that the door need a heavy push to close and the top basket is too high, so pint glasses CAN'T be washed in that tray. This is a complete design balls up, so avoid this dishwasher if you wash a lot of pint glasses. The odd one or two can be washed in the lower tray. Shame as this dishwasher could easily have been 5/5.",Approved

"The fridge is well made and good looking in stainless. In white ( which we originally wanted) the stainless handle looks foolish. The fridge has a large, well lit interior. The capacity is much better than the usual under worktop or combined fridge/freezer, and better even than fridges with similar external dimensions.
Two problems - the fridge door is difficult to open, particularly just after opening and closing it. So if it is opened to get, say, a juice bottle to pour a drink, then when you go to replace the bottle the door will not open.
This leads to the second problem - the fridge moves if the door is pulled hard enough to open it under these conditions. You end up using two hands - one to pull the door, the other to hold the fridge still. Awkward.",Approved
Good all-round fridge with ample and useful storage. Would have liked there to be at least one divider in the vegetable bin and one or two in the door packets.,Approved
We bought one of these in January 2017 as well as a AEG double oven and the glass has cracked at the front edge already....just by giving it a sturdy clean after a pan boiled over. Not what you'd expect from a reputable manufacturer like AEG.  You have been warned....stay clear!,Approved

"Good Dishwasher, feels a little light on the door which could be a benefit or draw back depending on your point of view. Personally I like the fact it auto opens after it has finished its cycle. Also there is plenty of room inside. There is a delay from when you push the power button to when it turns on which is annoying but overall a good solid dishwasher. Also it suffers from not having any collapsible racks for pans and the cutlery box feels a little cheap.

However it cleans brilliantly ever time so I would re-purchase without hesitation.",Approved
Thie dishwasher was an included offer when we bought the kitchen. We are currently waiting for replacement as door had been dented in two places. However it is still usable & does what it is designed for. Not sure we would of bought this model in a shop though as racks flimsy given the look & feel of poor quality. The top tray is not designed to take more than one row each side for mugs or tall glasses so you have a o balance or put over the plate racks.,Approved

"The machine was delivered by two very helpful men who installed it and game me a quick run through of its features. 
The machine is stylish and looks lovely in our kitchen .
Considering the number of features it has ,it is surprising easy to use.
The spin cycle is the quietest I ever heard on a washing machine.
The wool cycle works brilliantly, two pure wool Aran sweaters came out as good as new.
I also like the steam feature the washing came out virtually crease free.
I will write another review in a month to say how the machine is coping.",Approved
"I bought this product with high hopes but it has let me down in more than one way. Firstly it has only lasted a month and has broken down, so everything in fridge and freezer totally wasted.
The fridge has compartments on the door that you can move around to store jars, drinks etc... but the depth of them leaves it very limited in what you can put in there. The fridge is of a large size though. The freezer is smaller than you think due to the thick walls of it, again this limits what you can put in it.
This will be the one and only time I will buy an AEG product because it is taking nearly 2 weeks for the service centre to come round and look at it.",Rejected

"The cash back from AEG and the in-line deal from Currys, made this purchase a no brainer. really pleased with the fridge. It's quiet - not noisy like it says in some of the reviews on Currys site. Plenty of storage and you can adjust the shelves to fit almost anything.

"The coffee tastes great. BUT
The machine does not last and over a relatively sort period of time starts to leak water with more water going into the drip tray than into the cup. We are on our 3rd attempt at a fix and even had a brand new replacement machine. This too has failed.
Packing and posting to Plymouth to a group of people who can't fix it is really wearing thin.

Buy another brand. Do not waste your money on AEG.",Rejected
Don't buy this product. It doesn't work properly. I am on my third set of pans and after 8 minutes a pan with a small amount of water is only simmering. Frying is no good as it just boils the food in oil. It does look very nice indeed which is (stupidly) why I bought it. If you don't do any cooking this could be the hob for you.,Approved

For a family of four adults it holds all our fresh groceries and since we have had this we have become used to items still staying fresh well beyond package dates, something we never experienced before. The amazing thing is that after 3 years, it still does.
I don't think we will be looking to replace this for some time (there is no need).
I am sure at some point it may need a repair or replacing but I honestly can't think of when that may happen - it has another 2 years of its warranty to go, so lets see.

"In selecting a new hob it took me a while to decide between gas which I always have used and newer induction technology, for its ease of cleaning and safety features.

In the end I chose gas because I like the direct control over the flame when cooking.  The control knobs are a nicely sized and are augmented with indicators that show if the gas is on and burners that may still be hot after use. There's also a handy countdown timer to keep track of cook times.

It's taken a few days to get used to get used to the power and positioning of the burners, they definitely have a higher output to my old gas hob and are closer to the wall because the controls are at the front.  The cast iron pan supports are nice and sturdy and unlike my old hob which had enameled supports, the pans don’t precariously slide around.  Cleaning the hob after use is straightforward and leaves it nice and glassy.

Overall I am very happy with this hob.  It fitted easily into the old hobs cut-out in the worktop, It’s got the safety features such as the gas switching off if the flame bows out and warning alarm if a burner is left on for a long time (which I discovered while making some chicken stock), Hob to Hood which will remotely control an AEG extractor automatically, plus looks great with my AEG oven.",Approved

From about 1 year in this job has just given me grief and has now given up totally the hob beeps 6 times and randomly turns its self off half way through cooking your meal. Try to reboot by turning off at the mains for a long period of time; turn it back on and it just stays on the loading page. On the odd occasion it decides to turn on we try and use it and it just continues to turn off. Very disappointed with the hob won’t by aeg again. Shame as the idea of the hob and design is great in theory just a shame it doesn’t work. Can’t afford to get it repaired as I can see that the most expensive part of this job is over £800; and it could only happen again. Time to buy a cheaper more reliable hob. Also says a lot that you can’t buy this hob anymore; aeg must know they had issues with them or they would continue to make them.,Approved

Pleasingly streamlined exterior, with full length door handle to suit tall and small users, contributes to the excellent overall design. All this and cash back too!",Approved
"This cooker has control knobs for each induction ring which makes it much easier to use than the version with the touch controls. Cooking on the hob is almost like cooking with gas. The hob stays clean and anything spilled does not get burned into the ceramic. The rings heat the pans quickly. The ovens are a good size also. The grill makes good toast. All controls are intuitive with the exception of the timers, but as the only timer we use is the minute minder the rest does not matter to us. There are three main irritations---1, No handles for the grill pan which means you need a cloth or oven gloves to take it out. A set of detachable handles would be good. 2, A fourth shelf rack for the ovens would not go amiss. 3, and lastly, the oven steam vents at the rear cause water to gather on the hob if a pan is sitting in front of one and also cause condensation on the wall above the cooker.",Approved

The pan supports were uneven when delivered and it was quite an ordeal to get to the right person to sort it out. Replacements sent quite promptly.

I am surprised that there is not one burner that will turn down very low to allow a very very slow simmer this method is required for certain cooking procedures. I am a former home economist with the gas industry with a wide experience and cooking knowledge. Perhaps I require a greater degree of heat precision than most average cooks. Because I could not see this appliance live before I bought it I had no idea about the effect of the different heat outputs on the various burners.",Approved

All the safety features but a plus is the electric plug is fitted so saved on t=an electrician to hook up the electric side of things. But it is an impressive size, does the job, My wife says it does not turn down low enough if you want to simmer. Case of finding the best ring to cook with.",Approved

"One used to have to choose between a sexy looking impractical thing with no grill or a British built device that was built like a tank but looked like one. This looks divine and cooks divine. Slightly disconcerting whisps of exhaust smoke which vent from the back of the cooker top apart, faultless so far",Approved
"We can’t believe how much quicker the pans heat up compared to our old electric hob! Cooking has become more enjoyable with this fab equipment, we would highly recommend!",Approved
"This not only looks the part but is very practical. We also bought the matching freezer and both work very well. 
Much better than the American style side by side fridge freezer we had before.",Approved
"The product was a replacement for our last hob, which failed after 5 years, it fitted into the cut out with a problem. The bevelled edge of the hob gives a much cleaner line. Each hob appears to bring pans up to temperature quicker than the old hob. Overall very pleased with the hob, but it is still very early days.",Approved
I've had two of these for 2 months now. Despite 4 visits from an engineer  thermostat still  does not work it only goes to 60 on one and the seal is faulty on the other. The opening mechanisms are flimsy and the spring load is different between draws.,Approved

"We recently revamped our kitchen and because I'm familiar with AEG appliances (had a washing machine and dryer in South Africa) we immediately looked  at buying a hob2hood, as well an oven. These have now been installed and I'm very happy with our  purchases, and the professional look of my kitchen.
The sleek, black-top-four-plate-induction hob has excellent features. For example;
Touch controls provide immediate required heat setting, selection between 1-14 + P for extra strength. I love this feature as I no longer have to boil kettles of water when preparing pasta. The water boils faster than a kettle ever could and as soon as pasta is added, you can turn the heat down, preventing overboil and splashing. Once you know your cooking times, you save even more electricity on a lower selected heat, because the plates maintain their heat evenly, no burning, no boiling over during cooking, and the plates cool off very quickly once the saucepan is removed. This is a large safety feature when my grandchildren visit - no danger of them activating the plates and/or getting burned. 
Perfect setup for cooking: As soon as you activate a plate, the hob light goes on and your work surface lights up; when water boils, the fan automatically goes on as well and adjusts itself according to the amount of steam released from your cooking; Water for a cup of tea, for example, boils within a minute - I don't use my electric kettle anymore.
Timer use: I use the timer once the contents have reached the desired heat. The timer clock is not overbearingly loud, but it is persistent. It's not an insurmountable problem, but I would prefer that the hood lights don't switch off as quickly as they do when the time is up on the timer.
I don't view my next comments as a disadvantage, but it is necessary to remember that you need induction safe cookware - could be an extra expense. However, I find that I don't need a lot of pots. I use a heavy-based stainless-steel steamer, pan, boiler, pressure cooker which pot doubles for a pasta boiler. You also need a special ceramic hob cleaner and soft cloths, and it is better to keep the cooking surface free of oil, but I don't find this a big problem, because I use a cover when frying and I make sure that the underside of the pot is dry before switching on, keeping a dishcloth at hand.
To sum up: The hob looks great; is easy to keep clean; works rapidly; responds to your every command and takes the pain out of conventional cooking - a proud appliance for any modern kitchen.
Again, not a disadvantage, but you must get to know your hob and all its features, and then you'll enjoy cooking up a storm in your kitchen! This hob is a wonderful addition to my and a great companion to other AEG appliances such as the extractor. Good value for money and long-term investment for me.",Approved
"I must admit I was very wary of buying an induction hob cooker. I read loads of reviews and everyone said how fast they were - I was somewhat dubious. I was wrong. They are stunningly fast, so very controllable and so easy to clean.
If I had to level one or two criticisms at it they would be that the main oven is a little too small and the top oven a little too large, but that could be just because I am comparing it to our old AEG. The other is that there is no grill pan handle. I must I find this one disappointing...
Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to reccomend it to anyone. Better than gas? Oh, yes.",Approved
Our new induction hob has really changed the way we cook. No more waiting long periods of time for water to boil. With the Power boost function water boils within seconds. A really modern design and easy to clean hob which is child safe.  A great addition to our Kitchen!,Approved
"Right, top tip first. When you switch to induction cooking, invest in a decent set of induction cookware. It is only then that you will realise the true magic of induction cooking.

My visiting mate from Italy convinced me to make change from gas to induction so I settled on the AEG (IKE64441FB) build-in model. Stylish looks and with loads of useful cooking tricks (without the clumsy gadgets).

I start my day with a bowl of oats. My water boils from zero to hero in just over a minute. I pre-set the plate to reduce after two minutes and I’m ready to swing by in five minutes for my morning brekkie. Gone are the days where I’m yelling cause the oats boiled over, leaving the pot and gas grill with a sticky porridge mess. In fact, spilled food wont stuck anywhere or caramelized as the heat is contained only around your pot (or pan). The hob has this super fast function called ‘power boost’ which is great for minute steaks or anything that needs boiling for example. Because your cooking time is reduced, common sense dictates that it must be more economical and thus environmental friendly too, which can only be a good thing, right?

The stop-and-go function makes it easy to finish other prep work, answer your mobile or send a text but what I love especially is that look slick as a whistle. Not a single control to turn or a flame to ignite, as it’s all done by touch-activated controls on a temperature scale. It feels different because there is not a lot of escape heat coming from the sides that one gets from a gas cooker for example. 

I have the habit of cleaning as I go along and it took me awhile to discover that I can wipe my hob almost as soon as I remove my cookware, how cool is that! Mightily impressed by my hob.",Approved
"We have had this AEG IKB64401FB induction hob for a few weeks now and are delighted with it. It looks really minimalist in our kitchen. There are four cooking areas (as opposed to usual rings) 2 medium, 2 large. Each area can be fully controlled independently of one another but also the two large areas can bridged to together to make a huge cooking zone. I have used this with my large oval cast iron casserole and it works brilliantly. 
The cooking zones area really easy to adjust using a touch slider or by tapping the temp you want. The pause function is really handy for those of us who are interrupted by the doorbell whilst trying to cook.   This basically puts all active zones in low power mode until you are ready to resume.  Each zone has its own timer function too, neat. For safety and reassurance there are a host of auto switch off features and a handy lock feature too. The hob also features something called Hob2Hood, that can magically control your compatible AEG hood for you, doing things like turning the light on and setting the fan speed for you, we don't have an AEG hood to comment first hand though, but certainly sounds like useful use of technology. Nice and easy to keep clean and looks really smart. You can buy this hob with confidence it is certainly a premium piece of kitchen hardware.",Approved
"Exactly what we wanted. Easy to use, quality engineered product. Easy to clean.",Approved

"My first impression of the new hob was how smart it looks. It has a  nice bevelled edge and clear and conveniently-sited controls.  On trying the new hob for the first time, the most striking feature was the speed of response. It was so much quicker than my old halogen hob. As the hob only picks up heat from the bottom of the pan, it cools down quickly after use and thus presents much less chance of burns from inadvertent contact. I ran a quick test to see how fast the right rear element performed against my electric kettle of similar power. I boiled a litre of water in an 18cm saucepan on power boost in 2 minutes 20 seconds, exactly the same time as my kettle! The controls are very good, particularly when selecting a particular heat setting. My old hob required the power level to be incremented from zero to the required level in single steps. On the new hob I can select the desired level by simply tapping on the appropriate number. With power boost, I can get to the right heat level even quicker. The residual heat indicator is useful and remains illuminated even when the power is switched off. If a pan is lifted off the hob whilst it is on, a fault warning is displayed. This also applies if an element is switched on without a pan in place. The bridge function looks useful, although I haven't had a chance to use it yet. The hob is very easy to clean. My only problem was that some of my saucepans were not suitable for use with an induction hob and had to be replaced. A small price to pay for enhanced performance. Overall a very well designed product.",Approved
Thanks for letting me testing ! For sure a lovely product,Rejected
"The hob is great. From the first time I saw it, it's neat and I like the way the buttons all disappear when you turn it off. 

Some of the buttons are a little close together and little tricky to use, but generally, it is a good hob. The alarm beeping could be a little louder, but I like the fact that when you set the timer, it then turns the pan off after that period of time too!",Approved
So pleased with hob good to clean and easy to control,Approved
"This is a beautiful looking hob. I'm a big hob user, I love this kitchen appliance and use it daily. It's easy to use and easy to keep clean. I've only used basic functions so far. It boils water ridiculously quickly, you do have to keep an eye on it, but no complaints. Highly recommended.",Approved
"Great product and looks amazing. The recommended cleaner is superb, well worth it!",Approved
This is a great hob. The heating areas are of good size and heat up incredibly quickly. Select the P setting and a pan of cold water will boil faster than any kettle could do it. The hob is really low profile and very easy to clean. The locking function means its also very safe if you have children.,Approved
"as annoying as my old pan becoming redundant was, once i replaced them i could use the sensor feature that worked out where my pan was and only heated that up, now im a messy cook and because the hob doesn't get hot it makes cleaning easier",Approved

It seems to cook fine but at low temperatures it makes an annoying clicking sound. I know that induction hobs can do this when they switch on and off to control temperature however this is annoyingly loud and very disappointing if this is as designed! I've not noticed it with other induction hobs. There is a video clip online of someone who has a similar problem and his turns out to be a faulty module. Maybe mine is too so I should get in touch with customer services.,Approved

However the bottom salad drawer compartment has been too cold since we bought it, it partially freezes vegetables. I have had numerous engineers out to try and fix it but the last one decided a part needed replacing but wanted to check if there had been problems with others before ordering. This was in February but it's now April and despite being repeatedly told they are chasing it, AEG are not responding. I didn't spend this amount of money to get something that doesn't work properly. So disappointed as we loved the design and if it had worked properly my only disappointment would be the speed at which the water comes out of the dispenser.",Approved

A nice smaller compact machine that still had the capability of a bigger one. Much quieter and also quicker,Approved
"I bought this hob to replace a cheaper induction hob which had cracked. I like the metal surround on this hob, I hope it will protect it from cracking too. However, with 14 heat variables, I find it difficult to operate. It is frustratingly difficult to switch on and change to an appropriate heat setting, although it does seem to be good on low settings. It is also very noisy. The fans within the hob seem to be somewhat over enthusiastic. In truth I would rather have my old hob back. :(",Approved
"Having owned an AEG washing machines in the past and being convinced by it build quality and performance, I snapped up the opportunity to review the AEG - L6FBG741R, 7 kg

Just to be clear AEG offered me this machine for free in return for writing this review.  I will give my honest option without any sugar coating to allow you to make an informed decision when it comes to buying your new washer.

The washing machine performs really well and the clothes come out clean and fresh, even on a low temperature and short cycles.  What I really like is that the machine weighs the load and then adjusts the cycle length accordingly.  

The AEG blends in really well in my kitchen and doesn’t look out of place. The drum design is different to what you would normally expect. It does not look as deep yet still holds 7Kg (which is plenty). There is a honey comb effect and the paddles are of a wave effect. I guess all this is in aid to protect your clothes inside during its cycle.

With its A+++ energy rating the water intake and electricity consumption is greatly reduced when compared to my old machine. Lower energy bills are always welcome

The AEG L6FBG741R currently retails at £499 which places it into the mid price range in my opinion.  For all the features and result it’s a price well worth paying

The machine has bucket loads of programs and additional features such as soft/plus, extra rinse and adjustable spin and temperature to your personal preference. With its big dial programs are easily selected and its big door allows for easy opening and loading

 The washer is silent when running, you don’t even realise that it is on most of the time! The spin is still rather laud when stood right next too, yet a lot quieter than belt driven machines. It’s one of them things, if the drum is spinning at 1400rpm there is bound to be a little noise. At least the washing comes out as dry as you can expect after a wash. This allows for quicker drying times on washing line or tumble dryer.",Rejected
Only problem is have to do the extra rinse and spin as separate task. Previous machine allowed you to programme I .,Approved
"This machine is on twice a day, most days. Nice quiet appliance. Really like the quick & super quick options",Approved
We are very pleased with this product which replaced our 10 year old AEG washing machine. It has a great range of operating options and it is simple to use.,Approved
Instruction and control of machine very easy and washing results were as good if not better than my previous machine. I would recommend it.,Approved
"After a machine that nearly took off in the spin cycle anything was going to be good but this machine is grrreat. It is faster and so, so, much quieter. It has a large selection of cycles including one for down jackets. And there is an ""eco"" selection which helps to cut down water and power use. I am very pleased.",Approved
This is an excellent product takes a bit of getting use too . It has one fault the audible alarm is not loud enough by any stretch of the imagination.,Approved
"So far have used the machine about 6 times and am very pleased with the general wash, simplicity of use, large choice of options and overall look of the machine",Approved
Good sized load 8Kg. Can shorten programmes for quick wash. Good choice of spin speeds. Let's hope it lasts as long as my last machine - 15 years!,Approved
"I love this inductiin hob it is a great way to cook, easy to use and takes half the cooking time of before with no chance of burning myself.",Approved
"The product was delivered on time and in the short period of use, results are what you would expect of a well engineered product .

The setup and use of the product instructions are clear and simple.

Given the various programmes available, ease of use due the design makes this product top of its class.",Approved
Hoses did not fit in plumbing and couldn’t get the end off to fit in plumbing. Leaking everywhere. Need to pay extra for kit and plumber. Rest of machine is good,Approved
"An excellent replacement for our old AEG machine.  Very quiet, easy to use and does a great job of washing.  Particularly like the large capacity (handles bulky items with ease) and the Prosense feature that automatically adjusts the length of the wash cycle depending on the amount of washing saving time, water and money.  Build quality is up to AEGs usual high standard. Would definitely recommend.",Approved
"This machine is reasonably quiet, the 1400 spin is very quiet. The controls are easy to understand.

The main reason for purchase was the 10kg load and the 'very large' door, greatly improving the chore of laundry.

Be aware, the front of this machine, i.e the door, bows out, giving a total depth of 66cm. 

Overall I,m very pleased with this attractive and efficient washing machine.",Approved
I was forced to buy a new washing machine due to my old one having broken down and after on-line research I chose this machine. Ive always preferred German branded white goods and I am highly delighted with this machine and would recommend AEG Products to anyone.,Approved
A one touch memory button to program most used programs,Approved
"This is a great washing machine. Firstly its capacity is huge which is a real help with a family, and access is simple with such a large door. Second, it is smooth and quiet in operation, unlike many previous machines we have had. Third and most important it does seem to wash well. A good range of programme options means it has coped with everything we have thrown at it. Finally, the controls are straightforward and the information display is clear and easy to figure out. Overall this is by far the best washing machine we have owned .",Approved
"I received this washing machine in order to conduct this review. I have been using it for about two months to ensure I got to grips with it and to give a fair opinion on it. 
The machine has a 10kg load and whilst I very rarely got up to this amount of laundry for a load, I feel the large drum does give the clothes plenty of room to move and tumble. This may account for the clothes coming out feeling soft without the addition of fabric softener. It is energy rated as A+++. We found it not to impact on our electric costs even though the eco wash times average about 4 hours for the cotton washes that we used most. All our white goods are AEG (washing machine, tumble dryer, tall fridge, tall freezer, oven and steam oven), and averaging about a wash a day to dried as well, our electric use for the day comes to about £1 in total. 
The machine in use very quiet, and apart from the noise of the laundry sloshing in the water we did not notice hardly any noise coming from the machine even when it was doing the final spin. A friend came around and even commented how impressed she was with the quietness of it. 
With the addition of fabric softener and the Soft Plus option selected, it is noticeable how much softer the clothes are compared to it not being used. Especially on my little toddlers cotton clothes. 
Wash times range from 20 minutes for a quick light wash to 5 hours. The length depends how Eco you want, for us time didn’t matter as we had it going while we were at work or on over night. 
Even though we were conducting the review during the summer months we managed to do a few woollen washes, and our clothes came out as if done by hand but without the effort of it. 
The anti-allergy setting is a good one to use for a antibacterial wash. We used it for bedding, towels and cloths. Handy if you have a pet that likes to sleep on your bed too.
Similar to my old AEG washing machine, it weighs the laundry. But it uses this information to adjust wash times. We couldn’t adjust the detergent quantity with the information like the old one as it does this during the wash cycle and not before, a feature my wife missed. 
It was very simple to install. The only fiddly part was sticking on the noise reduction rubber seals that sit between the feet of the machine. One cold feed, an outlet hose and power lead. 
It is an excellent washing machine, perfect for a family. If it gave me the detergent amount similar to my old machine, I would give this 5 stars, but with everything there is always something that can be improved upon, so 4.5 stars is my verdict on this machine. A joy to use, as much as a washing machine can be I suppose.",Approved
"This induction hob cooker is excellent. Both hob and ovens have very good features, but I haven’t tried them all yet. I particularly like the “power” boost on each of the hob cooking zones. Ask me again after Christmas when I will have really put it through it’s paces. The control panel is easy to use and cleaning the hob is a dream! Overall, It is a pleasure to use.",Approved
"Time will tell how it stands frequent washing,so far so good",Approved
Good washing for a family with young kids. Your able to choose the wash time from 3 lengths on cotton and it still spins to the highest speed which reduces drying time. Love this product would def recommend.,Approved
I have had a few washing machines over the years! I particularly like this Aeg machine for its ease of use and the finished condition of the articles it washes. I particularly like the soft rinse function. I also like the fact that it is more energy efficient than my previous machines and does not use more water than necessary. I find the 20 minute and outdoor cycles useful. The only thing i would criticise is the fact that the cottons programme seems to be able to take more weight than the synthetics  but i wonder if this is to prevent creasing. The delay start button is great particularly if you want to wash overnight. I would recommend this machine. I like both its appearance and functionality.,Approved
"Model L6FBG741R , 7 kg front loading machine allowing me to do synthetic or cotton based small lightly soiled loads  as well as full loads of cotton based towels and bed linenusing the minimum amount of water and getting the maximum cleaning.  Feel confident that delicate fabrics will not be overwashed or damaged  and that by using the lower temperature options I can reduce my energy consumption.
Have done around 20 washes in it in the past  two weeks  and feel confident I have made a good choice.
Only thing I'm not sure of is about the  indicator for max weight.  It is a good reminder but so far I've been unable to find out if this indicator can tell you if you have put over the max in for that cycle.",Approved
Impressive washer. Economic efficient great choice of programmes,Approved
"This cooker is great and easy to use.
The way it cooks is impressive and quick the time it takes to heat food is in no time at all as long as you have steel based pans.
The ovens work really well and cooks evenly 
Great cooker so far",Approved
"I have been using this washing machine for a couple of weeks now, and I am delighted with it. Firstly, it looks stylish and is easy to use - it comes with just the right mix of great technology without an overcomplicated interface - there is one manual dial alongside a variety of LCD display buttons to personalise the programme selected.. One of it's main strengths is the large door and drum area - a new design feature is that there is a lot of space at the front of the machine where you need it, rather than tucked away at the back of the drum. There is a wide variety of programmes, which can be personalised by adjusting spin speed, time saver options,  and start times. The 20 minute fast wash is a great option (although you should not use the whole 8kg capacity with this  - 3kg max load is recommended).  The machine's sensors adjust according to load, but if you want to have a faster wash than suggested, for example, you can use the time saver options for your own convenience. The machine is quiet, seems easy to keep clean and I am more than happy with it!",Approved
Have been using the machine for four weeks now.  Really quiet and effective,Approved
This is a solidly built machine. From the outset it looks well built and is reassuringly heavy and the washing results it provides are wonderful. It can deal with any kind of fabric and I don't worry anymore whether I was right to wash such and such expensive piece of clothing. Even the really delicate garments are washed so gently that they come out in perefct condition. I hope it last but so far I am overjoyed with my choice,Rejected
"This washing machine cleans as well as any other I've had. There is a short cycle of 20 or 30 mins (depending on temperature chosen) which is a great benefit. I've never seen the need for cycles that last two hours or more, pointless waste of electricity.

Build quality seems fine, as you'd expect for a modern appliance (i.e. it probably won't last as long as they did in the old days) but I've only had it for a couple of months so far.

The spin is a a bit iffy. If you wash just a few items, it can't seem to get up to a full speed spin. It messes about turning slowly for several minutes, and never gets up to full speed. I've had clothes come out quite damp still. It seems to need a good load in order to spin properly, so my solution when washing just a few light-weight items is to put a bath towel in with them, just for the spin cycle. This extra weight lets the machine do a proper spin. Rather odd, as I've never seen this problem with other machines.

I'm a little suspicious of the rinse - it gives two rinses on the cycles I've tried, and there always seems to be some soap suds in the water as it does its final drain, so I wonder whether it really has got all the soap out of the clothes properly. I don't use much soap powder by the way, in fact quite a small quantity. You can set an extra rinse, but not on the short cycle, which is a pity.",Approved
"I’ve been using this machine for a couple months now and I’m quite pleased with its performance.
The main improvement from my previous washing machine is the more efficient shorter programmes. ProSense technology automatically adjusts the cycle time according to the washing load weight, which is particularly useful when washing a smaller load, it can decrease the washing time by as much as 1h. This gives great flexability as you can wash a small load using you favourite programme. On the downside this will affect the time delay option since it takes about 15 minutes to adjust the cycle time and makes it harder to predict the time when the wash will actually finish.
There is a great variety of washing programmes which can be customised to your particular needs. Another good feature is that all programmes I’ve used so far are very silent even during the spin cycle.
The front panel looks stylish, is easy to use, has a good feel on the digital menu buttons and all options are quite straightforward. It’s also very easy to clean.
With a big drum and larger door than usual you would think that it would be easier to fill in with clothes, however while loading the drum smaller items keep falling off as they won’t get trapped around the inside of the drum. This is due to the door being roughly the same width as the drum itself. When fitting larger items such as bed sheets or a duvet this isn’t a problem.
This machine has a very modern look. I’m not very keen on the silver door frame although this is down to personal taste.
Overall this machine has great features and a good performance and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a top end washing machine.",Approved
"Stylish in looks with a white chassis and silver trim, this washing machine looks very smart in our utility room. It has many functions and is simple to use. It's handy that you can reduce the time of each cycle function by clicking on the 'time save' button, however in general the washing cycles seem very long with the shortest wash being over an hour still. There is a quick wash which is only 20minutes and this seems to work well for general-not too soiled -loads but is unsuitable for sportswear or soiled children's clothes. I would recommend this to anyone, particularly families with 1 or 2 children as the drum size is adequate for this.",Approved
Really great washing machine love the steam feature,Approved
Its very easy to use and looks great easy to clean love it,Approved
"Quiet, good spin speed, all functions simple and intuitive",Approved
This washer has all the washing programmers you need. It is really easy to use and is super quiet. With its large drum you can get a lot of washing done in one load. The 20 minute quick wash is great when you need something fast.,Approved
Having had an old hot plate design hob which took ages to heat up and cool down. I wanted something that saved energy and cooled down quickly. I went with this induction hob because firstly it wasn't too big as I am limited to space and secondly I loved the design and features. Now my cooking takes a fraction of the time and nothing gets over cooked or burnt and love the timer feature I now cook my pasta perfectly. It was the best purchase I've made for my kitchen.,Approved
"I love the fact that each ring on the hob and both ovens have access to individual timers. The induction hob is very precise, when lowering the temperature it is almost instantaneous. Lots of nice features like the oven shelves have a little lip so that dishes can't slide off when you pull the shelves out. I am actually enjoying cooking for a change. Can't fault the cooker so far.",Approved

"We've had this washing machine for a month and It's been absolutely brilliant. It has a very large capacity at 9.0kg which I've not managed to fully utilise yet - that's a lot of clothes! There are several options for different types of clothes, including cottons, synthetics, duvets(!) and outdoor wear. It's really easy to manually change the temperature and spin speed too, although it did fool my husband for a second as he didn't realise it was touch screen! The 'stains' option is one of my new favourite options - I popped the shower curtain in there which was a bit grim at the bottom, not expecting too much as my previous washer hadn't got it particularly clean, but with the stains option on it came out like new! I genuinely couldn't believe it! All in all I've been very impressed with the product. I found the handle design a bit weird to start with, as it's a bit higher than usual but I'm used to it now.",Approved
"Aesthetically pleasing design with touch menu selection and large easy read digital display. 
The door has a simple pull open design and spacious opening into a generous 9kg drum. 
The soap and conditioner dispenser is easy to use. 
The selection of 10 wash cycles vary from a short 20 min cycle to a 95 degree cotton cycle or simply just spin 
The innovative 'Pro Sense' function cleverly detects the weight of the washing to enable the most economical wash time and water usage. 
There is a 'time save' function which is so convenient if you want to reduce or increase the wash time. You can also choose to have an extra rinse or rinse only. Temperature and spin speed controls gives you the option to contol cycles for different fabrics and the 'wool and hand wash safe' option gives you peace of mind with your delicate fabrics. 
The machine also has a stains and pre wash cycle and if you prefer to use your machine at a more convenient time there is a time delay function. 
The wash and spin cycles are surprisingly quieter than my previous AEG washing machine. 
The only drawback to this model is there is no 'refresh' function which I miss as a handy option to washing. 
Overall the AEG L6FBG942R washing machine is easy to use and very functional.  
Highly Recommended",Approved
"This machine is an absolute joy to use. Fitstly, I love the contemporary design and the machine is so easy to use with its washing option panel. One of the great features is the child lock feature which is very useful as my two young children are always trying to open the washing machine door. When using this machine when the clothes come out the drum they are really clean and still feel great! With other machines there has always been excessive water still in the clothes even after the last spin but not with this machine and the machine is so quiet , it's really innovative of AEG and of superior quality than any other machine I've had in the past! Excellent!!!",Approved
"Long awaited induction hob and does not disappoint. Design is very subtle, but very easy to use when activated. Very quiet and efficient. Delighted.",Approved
"This is larger than my previous AEG washing machine, with a 9 kg capacity as opposed to the 7 kg capacity of my previous one.  
You might think 2 kg wouldn't make  much difference, but believe me, it does, it's amazing how much more washing you can put in there. There's even a programme for a single duvet, which I have used to wash a sleeping bag.
If however you only have a smaller wash, no problem, the ProSense technology actually weighs the washing and reduces the washing cycle accordingly, saving on water, power and unnecessary wear.
The machine comes with a wide range of programmes  with the option to set the temperature you require, independently,  including Anti Allergy, Wool/ Silk, Duvet, Outdoor (for sports fabrics such as lycra etc. ) and a short 20 minute  refresh programme. 
There is also a time delay function, a child lock function, and the machine switches itself in to standby five minutes after  completion of the cycle to save energy.
The wool cycle is excellent, wool mark approved, and as gentle as a hand wash.
This is a big capacity machine, but it  is very quiet in operation, with a nice big viewing window.
The controls are easy to use,  and all in all the machine does everything I need from a washing machine., with everything I have washed coming out perfectly 

Built to the high standards I have come to expect from AEG,  it comes with a one year guarantee, which is  extended to two years when you register the product..",Approved
Still learning with our new cooker but we cannot believe how much quicker and cleaner cooking is having used gas cooking all my life and this cooker is a revelation will never go back to gas and really find induction cooking much better,Approved
The thing I noticed first about this washing machine was that it is really quiet. We have it next to our kitchen and our previous one was much louder and therefore more intrusive. The AEG is very quiet so you hardly notice when it is on. We use the delay start button a lot so we are not leaving laundry in the machine for long if at work or overnight. The time save feature will shorten the cycle if you are in a rush. The drum is larger than average at 9kg and has a duvet cycle. It senses how large the load is and automatically adjusts the settings to save time and energy which is very clever. One of our children has allergies to animals so we can use the anti-allergy feature for their clothes. The controls are very easy to understand and use and the build quality is excellent as you expect from AEG. I have been really pleased with this product and would thoroughly recommend it.,Approved
Efficient and silent. Really pleased with it. Quite aesthetic too,Rejected
"The AEG 6000 Series washing machine is without doubt superior to any washing machine I have used in the past . Firstly, the machine looks very contemporary with a simple easy to use board of washing options. I love !!!! that it is so quiet when it's in use and the child lock safety feature is very useful with my two young children in my home who constantly try to open the washing machine door, so it's excellent safety wise for them. Also the clothes when being washed and spun when the cycle finishes the clothes are clean and still feel really good and most of the  water has left the clothes, unlike other machines that I have had in the past, when the cycle ends the clothes are still quite damp. My jumpers even kept their shape! A really good machine!!!",Approved
This washing machine does not just work great but also looks great i was quite amazed by how efficient it is for me because it helps me save energy on water consumption and i was impressed how all my garments came out feeling fresh.,Approved
"It is great the wool wash I have washed table clothes with sequins, tassels etc on and they come out as good as they went in but cleaner a great purchase do not hesitate to buy this washing machine.  I have fell in love with the AEG products so much that I have also bought an oven, induction hob and tumble dryer would recommend every AEG product that I have purchased only a dishwasher to purchase now.",Approved
"The first thing I noted was the large drum size compared to the size of the machine, which was smaller than my old machine despite having the same capacity. Most importantly for me, the spin is impressively quiet even on the maximum 1400 rpm cycle. I love the simplicity of the operation, which the machines manages to offer even while giving so much scope to tailor the cycle to your needs. I'm impressed by the apparent quality and general feel of the machine, and being something of an energy-saving geek, I was attracted to the A+++ rating and the brilliant feature whereby water use and cycle duration are automatically adjusted according to the weight and size of the specific load. Highly recommended.",Approved

"Can’t fault my new washer, looks good love the design of the door definitely easier loading and unloading. First thing I noticed was how quiet it is when it spins, I like the fact I know exactly how much time is left till the wash is finished  by the digital display. Brilliant technology knowing how full the machine is and adjusting water intake.  To sum it up I’m very pleased with the washing machine and the end washing results .",Approved
"Great Machine, easy instructions. You will needed a pack of  dish washer salt to get the best results. Nice and quiet, even a sounder when the cycle ends which is handy when you are working busy at home. The 20min quick wash is just great when you are in a hurry. The items come out very soft compared to other machines i have had. I would and have recommended the machine to our families and friends",Approved

When you load the laundry, you can manually reduce the hot water temperature, washing time and spin speed, If you don't adjust the time, the machine cleverly weighs the load after a few minutes and reduces the wash time after a few minutes. So a cotton 40 c wash that took around 2 hours on my old machine gets reduced to around 1 hr 20 mins on the new machine. I'm very pleased - time saver mode on my old machine meant that the entire wash was done with cold water - the new one still uses the hot temperature you specify. I have noticed results look brighter (not garish, just very nice representation of colours and very clean whites) but I'm not sure if this is the machine or change of detergent - from powder tablets to liquid of the same product - non biological.  But this one uses a lot of water so I think rinses very well. Haven't tested the tumble dry yet, that function is emergency backup for me, as laundry dries quickly and well on a large folding drying rack. One other plus- this machine operates even more quietly than its quiet predecessor, with less noise and vibration on the 1600 spin.",Approved

The fridge is all that I wanted it to be and is so quiet,Approved
"This appliance was the last to be delivered in our new kitchen order. We have bought AEG oven, hob, dishwasher, washing machine and tumble drier. When we first started to use it the motor cover in the freezer was not fixed and I had to fix it myself. The right hand fresh food container in the fridge cannot be removed because the bottom door shelf blocks it. The shelves are all glass making it impossible to lay bottles on. I know there is a wine rack available but I find the website incredibly frustrating to use. In addition the controls are very high and difficult to reach.",Approved
"we purchase this fridge / freezer from curry after a long search which included a message to AEG customer service to ask which model superseded our original unit, it was delivered and fitted with no problem and has performed like wise. the freezer does what it does freeze with no ice on either the food or cabinet and the fridge is clean bright and cold, frost free. ( ours is integrated )",Approved

"This is my third AEG washing machine (the previous models each lasted 10 years +). The first thing I noticed was the classy new styling, and being a guy, I was really looking forward to the LED touchscreen (sad, I know!). The door opening is a lot bigger than our last model, and the handle has moved up towards the top - so less bending down to open. The machine takes a whopping 10kg (not sure if this is a record?) so having the bigger opening is really handy. I also saw on the dial a ""Duvet"" setting. When I checked the manual (a bit of a let down given the quality of the machine) you can safely wash your duvets - never seen this before - rather than taking to the dry cleaners (or more likely in our household, just buying a new one!) So I was intrigued and tried it, Really, really pleased with the results. There is also a Pro Steam setting. The website says it reduces creases by 30%. I was a bit cynical but it does actually work!. 
I had a steam feature on my previous model and we use it the most just to give jackets a 10 minute dry cleaner refresh. They seem to have improved it quite a bit because no ironing is needed. Last thing. There is a setting which is supposed to improve the effectiveness on the fabric softener. Not sure how it works, but it actually does! Shirts smell so much better out of the drum, and keep it for longer. Very happy with this machine.",Approved
"I have had this AEG L7FEC146R machine for several weeks now and given it a pretty good workout catching up on all the washing from where the old one failed and washing several items that I didn't trust the old machine not to muck up.

First impressions – It looks good – the front panel matching in with the kitchen and it’s very quiet as well – unlike my last machine it’s possible to have a conversation – even a telephone conversation – in the kitchen while it’s spinning at full speed.

Next thing to like is the size of the door.  It’s huge. And behind it is a 10kg drum that’s just as big – it’s virtually the whole width of the machine so it easily swallows big items like one of the kids single bed duvet and would probably wash a double bed duvet without to much problem as well.

Use wise, it’s simple to select one of the 10 programs with the large dial, make any adjustments on the touch panel such as spin speed or temperature and press start.  One of the things that worried me at first was the length of time the display said some of the programs take, but what I have found is that the first thing the machine does at the start of a program is to weigh what's in the drum and it then adjusts the program for the size of the load – so often it decreases the time a load will take.  Even better though is the time save button which for lightly soiled loads will shorten the wash cycle – a synthetic wash starts at 2:18 press once to decrease to an hour and a half and a second time to just over an hour. 

So - How well it washes.  AEG in it’s marketing makes a great deal of it’s Absolute Care technology for washing and drying.  It’s has gained Woolmark accreditation meaning that hand wash woollen items can be machined washed and dried in it’s machines.  My daughter has a hand wash woollen throw on her bed that she absolutely loves and till now has forbidden me to wash because she didn't want it to stretch or go ‘weird’.  I’m happy to report that the machine did a great job – probably way better than me trying to hand wash.  It has no stretching - I measured it before and after - or matting of the fibres.  So now it smells better and she still loves to snuggle under the throw.

I have used about half of the wash programs so far including wool and duvet programs and found that the machine does a really nice job on all our washing even at 30deg and with a soap powder rather than a liquid.

Finally – Running costs.  The machine is rated as being 30% better than A+++.  Well with no other changes since getting the AEG tumble dryer at the end of June and the AEG washing machine mid August our average electricity usage has gone down according to the Smart Meter.  It also comes with a full 5 year parts and labour warranty so it fixes my costs for the next 5 years.

To recap - As a single working dad to 3 girls of school age, I wanted a machine that was simple to use, quick and quiet so I can run it in the evening if I have to, economical and have a good warranty.  This AEG machine more than fits my criteria which is why I give it top marks.",Approved

"It felt a little costly paying the price for this fridge freezer however having experienced the model down from this one (another story!) this one is worth it.

Frost free is the way forward and this product definitely doesn't disappoint. Plenty of room and really easy to fit.",Approved
"Effective wash. Towels come out much cleaner than the old machine. Short wash cycle (3kg) is very useful. Reasonably quiet. 
Washed a light weight summer duvet and a number of velvet curtains  with no problems. Have yet to try the outdoor clothing wash but this was one of the reasons I went for this machine.

"I can recommend this fridge freezer for any home. It is quiet so can be located in any room - kitchen, utility, garage, etc. The freezer is a good size and would cater for any family. The drawers pull out easily and being clear it is possible to see what is inside at a glance.

The fridge works well for me although I admit it is difficult to pull out the lower drawer on the door side. It can be moved part of the way but it is easier to remove the other drawer and then slide this one across. The drawers are quite deep which some people might find an advantage but shorter drawers would mean more fridge space above.

I am more than happy with my purchase and would recommend this model to others.",Approved

"Really happy with this; it's our first induction hob and it easily lives up to expectations. It's fast to heat up and react, is intuitive to use and looks great inset into the worktop. I've 'only' given it 4/5 for design as the outer edge doesn't sit fully against the work surface - there's a small gap between the bottom of the glass and the worktop, just big enough for crumbs to get in (a piece of kitchen roll fits in there and that cleans it out well enough).",Approved

"It didn't heat up faster than our previous gas hob - two zones were not recognizing the presence of pans. AEG customer service was the worst, didnt know if the product is under warranty or not!!. 
And the repair center is a joke!!! full of lies to cover up. No professional attitude. Service center arranged a repair date - one week later informed parts have to be ordered (without seeing the problem of course). Two weeks later when I pushed for a date for the repair I was told parts have arrived. Next day morning 7am, someone came, just checked the installation, didn't switch on the product and said you need to send it back to the seller.

I am still waiting for the parts to be delivered from aeg or should I say electrolux, so currently I have a hob that only half works (right hand side) but we should not use as advised by the repair, man...  So we have had a nice looking hob that does not work due to poor manuafacturing...  Not happy - I am sure there wont be any form of compensation from aeg (electrolux) either, so I am left to wait in the hope that the spare parts arrive soon so the hob can be fixed...

"I bought this machine about a week and a half ago.  I did buy it in The Netherlands so the model number there is L7FE06ES. But as my Dutch is poor and this machine is great I wanted to write in English. It produces fantastic results. My clothes are beautifully clean and soft. I have 3 dogs so I have a lot of heavily soiled items. I don't think they've been this clean in years! It's like getting a new wardrobe and bedding collection! The steam function for decreasing and refreshing has saved so much work and the results are fantastic. I even braved doing delicate wool items and silk curtains. Flawless! I'm quite amazed! Zero damage to these delicate items and they look beautiful. I did one set of curtains and compared them to an identical set that had just been dry cleaned. Night and day. The dry cleaned ones look so dull and dirty in comparison. I wish I could attach a photo. The result was really shocking. No more dry cleaning silks for me! I've owned many AEG washing machines over the years that I rated very highly but this one blows them out of the water. It's also removed dog hair much better than my old machine. I tend to find it balled up in the edges of the machine and easy to remove rather than wound around the clothes and the filter. I have much less lint rolling to do. The design is also very beautiful and it's very easy to use and clean. It takes the powder or liquids very well from the drawer apart from when you add to the stain removal compartment. That tends to have the most residue left. The touch buttons can skip a step every now and then but that's the only tiny thing I can find. My main issue is that the Dutch model has a ""jeans"" wash instead of a ""duvet"" wash. I contacted AEG UK and NL to find out if there were settings they could recommend to replicate this but neither responded to me at all. So it's 11 out of 10 for the machine but 0 out of 10 for customer service.",Approved

I tend to only use the cotton cycle as its the only one that allows more than 3kg, would have prefer an option for the light to stay on and so far I've noticed no difference when I use the anti crease.

All this fridge seems to do is make your food wet. Yeah it has handy little functions like fast freeze and quick chill but the plastic in the fridge is useless and cheap and has already broken and I have only had it since May this year.
There is a flaw in the shallow drawer. The lip where the little wheels run on, is not long enough and both sides have cracked on the edge and on one side it has completely broken off.
I am not sure what other integrated fridges are like, but I would steer well away from this. The freezer is pretty much useless and doesn't fit much food in. Enough food for one person, may be 2 at a squeeze.

"Five months of use and we are still very pleased with this machine.

Clothes always come out clean and fresh, and the spin cycle does a much better job of rinsing compared to our previous AEG machine (which was pretty good as well). Clothes come out much less damp which aids with drying times.

We find that there are a lot less creases in our clothes after washing, which makes ironing a lot easier. We have yet found a reason to use the steam function to see if that aids ironing further, especially as the normal cycle does a good enough job already.

The machine is fairly quiet, although you can hear a small whizzing sound at times when the rum moves. There is very little movement of the machine during spin cycles.

Functions and settings are clearly displayed and buttons are touch sensitive, apart from on/off switch. This takes getting used to as all of the buttons look the same, and look like they should be pressed rather than touched. We find that the responsiveness of the buttons could be improved, as they can (on rare occasions) either not respond immediately, or cycle through a number of options when you think you have only touched the button once.

Despite the slight issue with buttons, we would recommend this machine based on its wash and rinse performance, as well as noise.",Approved

"The hob was very easy to fit to the working surface and the electrician said it was very easy to connect up with no problems.,This hob comes with lots of great features such as child lock automatic shut off if you have a spillage ,slow cooking feature and timer ,very stylish to look at and very easy to keep clean with a high gloss glass panel easy to use controls and quick heat features going from cool to boiling liquids in seconds, you can use this as a slow cooker if needed just set to 1 and leave.A Good set of different size rings to accommodate most modern pan sizes",Approved
Purchased this hob along with a built in oven to replace the two items in our new home. What a great purchase. Who thought so much could be done with a hob. The front left is the largest ring ideal for grill panes etc along with the smallest ring on the front left. To the rear are two rings of similar size. Money well spent.,Approved
This product has fantastic quality coffee. All coffees are great favoured and very tasty.,Approved
I am very pleased with my new hobJust getting used to the speed it heats up.,Approved
"Our new L89499FL washing machine given FOC to us courtesy of AEG has been in daily use over the course of a week. In return we were asked to give an open and honest review.
First impressions are very positive. It's looks are modern and appears to be built to last. The controls are simple and the screen easy to read. It has a comprehensive range of programs each of which can easily be adapted to suit your needs. Selecting the right one for your wash is intuitive and takes little time.
AEG have taken time to think about what people expect from a washing machine in this day and age and have included some great features. A steam function allows you to freshen clothes without actually washing them. We tried it on shirts that hadn't been worn in a long time and afterwords found any mustiness to have disappeared. It also has a woollen program endorsed by Woolmark. This gave confidence that clothes would come out the same size as they went in. We used it twice and on both occasions jumpers came out clean and showed no difference in size once dry.
On the noise front we though our previous AEG machine to be quiet but this one is quieter still. It's barely noticeable on washing and spin cycles. 
Technology is at play in every wash as it automatically adjusts both water and energy needs according to the total weight of clothes (seen on screen). The benefit of this is that you save on household bills. 
Useful touches extend to the time delay function and the timer countdown feature. Being able to set a time, go do something else and have the machine automatically switch on at a set time is a bonus.
It's also nice to see a machine where the loading door opens 180 degrees allowing easy access for getting clothes in and out.
We found it's quickest wash was roughly 20mins @ 30'c. You might only use this once in a while but it's good to know in an emergency. The programs we used most frequently took on average between 1hr 30 to 2hrs depending on program, temperature and time saving functions used. More intense cycles last longer than this.
Over the period of ownership we've thrown all we can at the machine eg delicates, kids clothes, work overalls, dog blankets etc and can honestly say it took them all in it's stride. In short it does what it was engineered to do….give you clean clothes. 
 I would have no problem in recommending it to those looking for a new machine.",Approved
"This machine is so quiet which was my main reason for choosing it. It is in my kitchen and you would not hear it is even in operation unless it is on the last spin. The features are good too and very adjustable to suit in terms of time of programe or temerature, spin speeds ect. I also love the way it weighs the laundry and uses only the water it needs to. I highly recommend this machine",Approved
"This machine is brilliant, it is of a good design and the 9kg drum size is plenty big enough for a family of 5.  It has an excellent touch screen control and is very quiet compared to my old machine.  It washes clothes to a high standard, and you are able to use time saving function to reduce the amount of time taken to wash a normal or slightly soiled load without effecting the wash quality.  ProSense technology means that the machine measures the load of laundry at the start of the wash and will tailor the programme depending on size and fabrics used saving both time and energy.  The steam function also removes the creases out of clothes which saves on ironing time what more can I ask!",Rejected
"With a 9kg drum this can swallow big loads including duvets.  Gives great results and is nice and quiet.  Only wish there was a shorter washing programme available but it seems that nowadays they are all longer than they used to be.  I do find having to wipe the rubber etc to clear away fluff a bit annoying after drying towels but this is the first washer dryer I've had so assume it's part and parcel of a combined machine.  I also like being able to adjust spin speeds,  temperatures and dryness.  The instruction book could be a bit clearer with better English, so it takes a few reads to sink in. However, I would recommend reading it to get the best out of the machine.",Approved
"Well made, easy to store, the two in one feature is ideal,just remove the cleaner from the main handle and you have a second cleaner.",Approved
"Very pleased with our new washing machine. The machine has a modern appearance and a clear display which is easy to use. The Eco and Time Saver function work well and we are saving time (and money) with shorter wash times for smaller loads.It is also very efficient with an A+++ rating minus 30%.The machine is also extremely quiet.
One of the best features is the ""Pro Steam"" function which allows you to refresh hand wash items and also reduce ironing at the same time.  There is also a bonus of a five year guarantee.
A brilliant machine well worth the money.",Approved
"This washing machine looks good, it's sleek, white/chrome appearance was a modern addition to my utility room.   I had this machine installed around two months ago have got to know it well. From washing a duvet to steam freshening a blouse. ""It does what it says on the tin"" without fuss.  
The door handle is an integral part of the door,  unlike other machines, where the handle needs repaired or replaced after family use. The machine is easy to use (for someone who doesn't like to read instructions) it really was a case of turning it on and putting the clothes in.
The machine has the added bonus of ""time save"" on most programs and the steam program makes dry cleaning shirts/blouses a cost of the past.
The clothes leave the machine clean and smelling fresh, and require less ironing.
This washing machine is one of the best I have owned in twenty plus years.",Approved
"Well built cooker, easy controls, shame there was no handle for the grill pan included though!",Approved
Wife and I find design excellent also find cooking and cleaning easy,Approved
"Great design, loads of good features but is really a Zanussi/Hotpoint so quality not what I'd become accustomed to. Ovens wouldn't stay lit and might go out cooking a roast dinner only to come back to the oven an hour later and find a cold dinner! AEG customer Services said it was normal!?!? Rejected back to the supplier - no longer an AEG customer and as my washing machine and Dryer come round, time to look at another brand!",Approved
"Great Washer very quiet when spinning at fast speeds and takes a great load, and wash's prefect.
The only problem that we had was we had to have a call out and we had a wait 12 days before we got an engineer to come out (not a good service), the reason being we had a problem when we 1st used the machine. We followed the instructions and put the machine into its first cleaning wash without any items in the machine after about 10 mins it went into a fault that said the machine had a flood condition. The Engineer had to drain the water out of the flood tray and then put the machine into a 20 min programme this was OK and since then the machine has been OK. You should have a look at the idea of putting the machine into a wash programme without any items in it this could have been our problem",Approved

I bought this to replace a noisy washing machine where the bearings had gone after 4 years. Went for a better quality machine.  Very quiet spin. Seems well built.,Approved
THE AMOUNT OF SPACE IN THE FRIDGE IS IDEAL AS IS THE FREEZER COMPARTMENT,Approved
I'm quite happy with it and it's quiet compared to the last one I had.,Approved

I have never owned a washer/dryer before and was very interested to see how I would get on with it.  The first thing that struck me was that the detergent draw is very stiff and doesn't come out easily but I think that this might just me my particular machine.  The control panel  is very easy to read and understand and even though I carefully read all the instructions the touch screen was very intuitive and took no time at all to get used to.  Having used several of the programs I am overall very impressed with the ease and quietness of the machine.  I am a golfer and particularly like the technology program which washes and dries waterproofs. This worked very well and will be very useful.  The loads for washing and drying can not be very large and do take quite a long time but I have tried the time save modes and have again been very pleased with the results.  I love the wool cycle mode even though I was initially a little worried it might spoil my delicate clothes.  If you are looking for a quite and reliable machine with several excellent programs but without needing very large loads to wash and dry this is the machine for you.,Approved
"Very well build, with an overall nice appearance. Very silent which means you can set the delayed start and let it do the work overnight. We noticed that the energy consumption is quite low compared to older appliances. Used it for our synthetic outdoor jackets and the results were great.",Approved

Very happy with this new induction hob. Very clean and functional hob and a great replacement for gas hob.,Approved
"I have recently upgraded to the new AEG 7000 series front loading kombi washer dryer L7WB741R. This machine is well designed and extremely user friendly the panel display is LED and easy to read. The machine  boasts a host of many interesting and unique features here are a few that really benefited my laundry experience. DualSense Technology tailors the temperature and motion of the drum to different fabrics and adjusts programmes accordingly. Lower heat and controlled movement mean that everything from delicates to outdoor wear can be carefully washed and dried in one go. 
Another feature is theProSense Technology this automatically adjusts washing and drying times to the size of the load. enabling convenient and economical cycles saving  time, energy and water. Another feature that really helped with my laundry was the Wash and dry mode button choose one comprehensive wash and dry cycle so that clothes are cleaned in one go or you can select separate wash and dry cycles of your choice.
 but my favourite feature on theAEG 7000 series front loading kombi washer dryer L7WB741R Is Woolmark Blue Certification this washer dryer is the only machine on the market to feature Woolmark Blue Certification for both washing and drying processes and can safely wash and dry even the most delicate fabrics such as handwash only woollens, for me this is the ultimate feature from an excellent washer dryer.

THANK YOU AEG",Rejected
A nice looking fridge freezer combo that fits perfectly.,Approved
good - does what it says on the tin very well - but miss 1600 spin - after some washes have to run a second spin,Approved
A great oven and very stylish. Knobs push away neatly but unless your 6ft 3” you struggle to see the oven cooking selections and temperature needs. A transfer kit required to overlay on the main panel is required,Approved
"I was in need of a second washing machine in the house and having already owned an AEG for the past two years there was no arugument as to what I would go for next. I ended up getting AEG Washer Dryer L7WBG741R.
Right from the onset when they wheel the machine into the house you can tell the difference between an average run of mill brand and quality of AEG. Its got a solid base and feel very well made and secure. The pipe that comes with it to attach water inlet is in self the best that I have seen. It contains a small window through which you can see a ball showing if the water is flowing through. No guess work if tap is turned on. Now that is attention to detail that you see in everything in the machine.
One thing you will notice is how quite the machine is, you will only hear a quite wisper when it is a full spin. Otherwise nothing at all .
The buttons and knobs all just work and build quality is as you expect of a German machine.

On this machine intially I found that the touch buttons were a bit sensitive , It felt like they automatically changed by an accidental touch.  My last machine had knobs and so perhaps its my perception. It take a bit of getting used to , once you know how sensitive they are you adapt accordingly.


Overall I am very happy with the brand and having bought at least half a dozen appliances in the last 10 years , the quality of AEG is outstanding.",Rejected
Great choice of programs/temperatures/heat settings & so quiet I hardly know it’s on!!,Approved
"Bought this washer dryer to replace a similar AEG model which had provided many years of satisfactory service, unlike all its predecessors.",Approved
The washer dryer is incredibly quiet and makes laundry day a dream.,Rejected
"This is my first washer dryer and it is very easy to use. Depending on program selection, the display will show the maximum weight and time for washing/drying. The time will automatically adjust depending on the weight of the clothes. The wash & dry cycle is very quiet compared to my old washing machine. You can set this appliance for washing only or drying only. You can also use for washing and drying together but the time for both is very long so I use this setting during the night only. The delay start function is great, it allows you to set the machine for when the washing/drying will start. All in all I am very pleased with this machine.",Approved
"Very good fridge freezer but think AEG haven't quite got the split right for us, fridge too big and freezer not big enough.",Approved
"I was hesitant about swapping to a washer dryer but my sister in law sings the praises of hers and as I was in the market for a new machine and the British weather is a little unreliable, I thought I would give it a go!

This machine in my opinion is a winner.  My favourite feature is what I like to think of the ""Oh no, I was going to wear those jeans tonight"" programme. That moment when you see the jeans in question in the laundry basket an hour before you are meant to leave the house. The machine has a quick wash and dry programme which needs no human involvement and has those jeans ready before you are.

Additionally, there is a gentle, wool friendly hand wash programme which takes care of the children's school jumpers and my delicates at the same time. I was hesitant to trust the dryer with my hand wash items but am pleased to say that there will be no more hanging clothes off of my radiators all winter long.

The machine is also practical and easy to use for my more usual wash loads and economical as it adjusts the time for a cycle based on the size of the load which is great for my energy bills and the environment too.",Approved
"I have never used a washer dryer before and pleasantly pleased with this 7KG model.  It feels as though it's built to last and looks modern too.  The door opens fully to allow easy access to place your laundry.  The control panel is self explanotory and is really easy to use.  It offers the main programmes I would normally look for in a washing machine.  It allows you to select different temperatures and spin speeds separately so you can taylor your washes.  I like to use the 50 degree wash for a slightly hotter wash.   It also has a 'Quick wash' facility which allows you to reduce your wash time in 3 steps.  A 50 degree  cotton wash would take either  1:19, 2.10 or 3:14 minutes.  You  can also add an extra 1 or 2 rinses to certain wash programmes which would increase the duraration of the wash to an approximate 20 minutes.  It also has a 'ProSense load detection' facility which appears to reduce my washes by approximately 10 minutes.  I really like all these features and always use the extra rinse and quick wash on almost all the programmes I use. There is also a 'delay start' button which is great if you want a wash to finish at a time that's best for you.  I am impressed with the 7 KG size which caters really well for a family of  5,  I can even wash a single duvet with ease.   
The 'NonStop 60min' programme is ideal for small loads, wash and dried within the hour, great. You can also use the dryer without washing first too.
My only observation would be the detergent dispenser could be longer for ease of access.
Overall, I'm really pleased with this model and would definitely recommend it",Approved
"It’s just a washer dryer isn’t it? Well actually it’s a bit more – it’s an intelligent washer dryer.

Let me explain…. We need a large capacity machine for those occasional large loads such as duvets and loads of towels after the visitors have gone home. But more likely it’s a small load where you feel a little guilty about the amount of water, detergent and energy used to clean them.

But this is where the intelligence comes in. This machine actually weighs your laundry as you fill the drum and then tells you how much detergent to use and then goes on to reduce the length of the programme, both washing and drying, to match the amount of laundry. Goodbye guilt!

On top of all that this machine cleans the basics brilliantly, has a one hour combined wash and dry programme for those emergencies, and a wonderfully delicate woollens programme. Items we’ve only ever dared hand wash before come out as new.

All in all it looks good, it’s clever and it’s efficient.",Approved
"For years my wife has told me that she needs a separate washer dryer (she's banned me from helping as I get it wrong!) But no longer! We are amazed that the 60 minute wash and dry does what it says on the tin. The clothes are washed brilliantly and are dried completely in this time, so no putting on for extra drying cycles. It is incredibly straight forward and simple to use and looks great at the same time.",Approved
"This is the first time I opt for a washer dryer and I am amazed at the quality of the wash. I had no idea you could get results like this without taking clothes to the dry cleaning. My first load came out so well that I dared entrusting it with one of my favourite evening dresses yesterday. I was anxious as I really didn't want it to fade but  it actually came out better than when I put it in. The color hadn't moved one bit. How does that even work? It's almost like the fabric had returned to when I first bought it. It was all so soft. I was worried I would not really know how to get the best of all its features, but it's all quite self-explanatory really. No headache there.  It is also much quieter than my previous machine which means that I am not worried to disturb the neighbors anymore when doing a load after coming back from work. I feel I got more than my money's worth with this machine, definitely the best I owned.",Rejected
"Being wary of tumble dryers and their potential to damage clothes, using this machine was a revelation. Clothes are dried safely and feel like new. The DualSense feature allows hassle free clothes washing and drying in one easy go.",Approved
"I've only been using this hob for a few weeks but so far it's been great. Compared to my previous ceramic cooker hob it is faster, cleaner and has more functionality. In terms of responsiveness it is like gas but without the smoke. The power boost function boils water amazingly fast and the bridging function works great with a 28cm saute pan.",Approved
"Brilliant hob easy to use and clean which are the most important things lets be honest. heats up super fast and cooks food evenly even better than gas your food stays in the pan and not bubbling out all over the hob .
The hob to hood function is brilliant feature it’s turns on your extractor hood for you if it’s has the same function its a great feature to have.
10/10 and I don’t rate stuff lightly very fussy.",Approved
AEG have delivered a machine that apart from being solid in quality and build is the most efficient and clever machine I have ever used. I love the wash and dry cycle that uses its clever energy efficient technology to adjust to the size of the load.  Really pleased with this machine.,Approved
"Wow what a machine , Wash to dry in just 60mins and it actually does ! Saves me so much time with my children's school uniform.

I used to use the same programme for every wash on my old machine since i've been using my new AEG i vary all the cycles and it really does make a difference to my clothes i am sure they will last longer.

The steam cycle that takes 30 mins really helps getting wrinkles out of sheets no more ironing hooray !!  Ive even put my dry clean only coat into the steam programme it smelt musty and its now fresh it had no damage to it very gentle.

Its quiet whilst running has a count down timer which is handy also nice it beeps to tell me when its done.

The large drum packs a punch squeezed my duvet in and it came out clean.

Only thing i would be handy is a quicker wash i don;t always want to wash and dry. the time reduce is handy but sometimes still a little too long.

Would i buy AEG again YES I WOULD !",Approved
After our kitchen extension we were recommended to buy AEG appliances by our kitchen designer. Up to that point we had never come across a warming drawer but we could see the advantages of having one available. I make my own bread so having a place to prove the dough separate from the oven is a big timesaver and gets good results fast.,Approved
"very easy to set up from delivery, only 3 shipping bolts and connect and its all up and running. Wash programmes are very good and customisable with 2 x shorter options. Tumble dryer better than I thought it was going to be as olders machines used to take ages to dry. Overall a very good all rounder with some great features and silent running even on 1600 spin, very impressed",Approved
I have had washer/dryers in the past but nothing I've had compares to the quality of this one it is a piece of art the way it was designed down to the way it washes and dries the clothes I would recommend this to anyone even my grandma is amazed by the high quality of it that she has ordered one for herself .,Approved
"The drier replaced my old one which expired after 16 years. This one is luxury for me, choice of programs makes it very flexible for all types of clothes. Very pleased with my purchase.",Approved
"i have had this machine for almost 5 weeks and it replaced my 3year old AEG Protea Plus. i have nothing but praise for the performance of this truly amazing machine.  First the it has almost the same measurements as the Protea but possesses a 9kg drum instead. This means it slotted on the same spot perfectly. Easy to connect to the water and drain outlets; i very much like the intelligent capabilities of the machine. It has weighing and fabric sensors and will determine the length of a wash. The keys are very responsive by easy touch. For a washer/dryer it is very smooth and quite.  Packed with programmes enabling one a wide option for different fabrics, The 1600 RPM spin leave my clothes almost dry. I have not used the dryer much as the weather has been good, but the few times i have used it i have been very impressed by its ability to adjust to cycles. I particularly like the steaming programme. It means i don't have to worry about ironing my hard dry jeans and cottons anymore. Overall this is the best machine i have owned, and it does all it says. Phenomenal !!",Approved
"For a freestanding machine, the aesthetics of this machine are easy on the eye. It's beautiful design and sleek lines sit perfectly in my contemporary kitchen! 

The control panel is intuitive and responsive - which leads me to star feature no 1 , the ability to cancel a programme mid-way through if you change your mind and want to run a different one. 

The second shining attribute of this model was the genius Non-Stop Rapid 60 option which is perfect for a small load that you just need washed and dried within an hour - an absolute godsend.  

Third and by no means least is the steam setting which has proven very useful for invigorating the pile on delicate knitwear or indeed just freshening-up any garment . 

A special mention should also be given to the choice of drying settings which has taken the guesswork out of tumble drying. No more bone dry laundry that takes an age to iron! 

My only negative would be that this machine is a little noiser than my old machine when on full spin. That said, my last one was integrated so maybe that's why...",Approved
AEG L7WEE965R washer/dryer comes with a wider door that our old machine making it easier to see what is going on. The 9kg maximum wash load and wide door come in handy for duvets and the maximum drying load is 6kg. The machine automatically adjusts the washing and drying time to the size of the load giving an estimated completion time. This washer/drier has a useful program called nonstop 60 minutes in which it washes and then also dries a load automatically.,Approved
"The A.E.G. L7WEE965R washer/dryer is a technologically advanced machine that is pleasantly easy to use. It has a solid ‘well built’ feel, with all the controls operating with a precise action. When in use the machine is very quiet, and the powerful 1600 spin speed is almost vibration free. The numerous programmes cater for all types of washing and drying by weighing the clothing in order to calculate the best wash time and amount of water needed for that particular load. 
The user also has the ability to vary the set programmes with the use of the quick wash and wash temperature adjustment buttons, allowing for a personalised wash-dry for individual needs.
As a previous A.E.G. washer and dryer owner, I was surprised and pleased how this machine successfully combined the two. A very nice washer/dryer.",Approved
"We have owned this machine for approximatly 6 weeks 
and can only say that I am impressed by it's performance,
there are a good variety of programmes, including stain removal, 
pre-wash and delay programmes which have covered
all my familys needs, the most commonly used one being the cotton 
programme where I use 60°C for whites and 40°C for colours.
I particularly like the weighing scales which appear to be more intelligent than my previous machine, simply load the machine, select the programme, hit the start buttonand the machine automatically weighs the washing and then sets the time to efficiently complete the wash.
The machine has a maximum load capacity of 9KG 
(on certain programmes) and a maximum spin speed of 1600RPM
which removes more water than most machines.
There are three automatic drying modes available,
extra dry, cupboard dry or iron dry and the option 
of setting the drying time manually is also available.
The machine is very quiet in operation even when it is spinning at the max speed which is a massive bonus particularly when it is located in the kitchen.
As modern homes get smaller the advantage of owning a combination machine is also a great space saver
The downside of this machine, well I haven't found one.",Approved
Excellent product and quality is great. Really pleased with our purchase. Would definitely recommend,Approved
"Only had my machine for a week now and thus far hasn’t been a let-down. With a 9kg wash load and 6kg dry it’s a well-built machine. Exactly what you would expect from a German brand.
 
Installation and setup was easy. Just remove the 3 shipping bolts with the supplied tool. The water hose has flood prevention valve on the end which can be a pain to plumb in however in this case it wasn’t. The hose comes completely off so it's easy to feed in behind the kitchen cupboards. The tool to remove the shipping bolts also doubles as a spanner to adjust the height of the feet. 
 
Those of you who have a suspended wooden floor like myself will know washing machines they tend vibrate and shake the whole house. Well this one doesn’t. Even spinning at 1600rpm, it just does its thing. Even when fully loaded, the machine manages to balance the load first time do a complete spin without upsetting the whole house. I was surprised at how dry the clothes comes out - Especially with jeans as they usually come out heavy and wet. They were nearly dry!
 
The soap drawer is quite tight however from previous experience this is good thing. I've had a loosely fitting drawer on a previous machine and it caused the machine to vibrate when on spin - Not an issue on this machine.
 
The door opens wide and the opening on the machine is large enough to get your load in and out. The door itself appears well attached and doesn’t give you’re the feeling it's going to fall off or break easily when the kids are around. Also the design of the handle/door opener is great. There's no faffing about with buttons or catches. Just pull and the door opens. It's also high enough that you don’t need to bend over - probably a bonus for anyone with a bad back.
 
Washing performance has been great. Not had any issues thus far. The programs can be quite long but that appears to be the norm with modern machines. I have used the Eco Cottons cycle the most. My washing doesn’t tend to be dirty so I use the quick wash function which does the full cycle in about 90 minutes. There are shorter cycles including a rapid wash. The machine does shorten the cycle times depending on the size of the load and how dirty it is. Thus far it was worked a treat.  
 
The rapid wash also doubles as a wash and dry in 60 minutes for a few items. I've only used this once for a shirt and trousers which I needed for a night out. It does the job. Freshened up, clean and dry in 60 minutes. A great cycle for those items you need at short notice. One thing I must mention. The rinse on this machine is fantastic. You have the option to add additional rises to the cycle however I've not felt it necessary to do so.
 
The integrated dryer on the machine will never be as good as a modern separate tumble dryer however on the few instances I've used it, it seems good enough. Will be great for people that can't accommodate a separate dryer and have no other choice. It will be more than ideal. The only downfall is you can wash 9kg but only dry 6kg. Although, that’s the case with any washer dryer.
 
It took me a little bit to work this out so if you’re reading this I hope it will help. If you need to drain or spin on its own there is no dedicated program for this on the selector. You need to select the cottons program (for example) and then press the spin/drain button until the spin program light is selected. It's fairly simple.
 
Overall, great machine, excellent features and a good variety of programs and very easy to use. Very pleased with it. Solidly built and expect it to last. It is expensive but I'll defiantly say it's worth the money!",Approved
"Very easy to wash and dry clothing. Like the big door at the front to load washing into the washing machine. 
Cleans and drys clothes very well and not very noise when spinning. Very nice and easy to set programs for washing.",Approved
We find this a great appliance but with some reservations. Namely it doesn't have any space/s;ots for bottles and it doesn't appear to have as much room on the shelves. Apart from that it is a lovely appliance,Approved
I am very pleased with my washer/dryer. The programmes are easy to sort out and I have had no problems so far.,Approved
Really great design and features!  Very easy to select drying temperature and spin speed . Can't wait to use the steam feature!  All I need and more.   'm getting used to the touchscreen  controls.,Approved
"The machines programmes are easy to follow once you've read the instructions. The variability of the programmes are excellent for a machine that is used daily for a family consisting of 2 mucky pup children and 2 adults. I didn't realise until I bought this appliance how much my previous machine was under performing. It may be hard to believe but the clothes do come out looking so clean and smelling lovely and fresh.

Very pleased!

Excellent service and fitting of new washer/dryer. Very prompt delivery with excellent courier company. I was kept updated from start to finish.",Approved
"I'm loving my new cooker! I have always envied friends with gas hobs because they seemed so reactive. The hob on my new cooker works even more quickly than gas, bringing water to the boil in seconds and reducing it to a simmer at a touch of the controls. The two ovens cook evenly and are designed for easy cleaning. It took me a little time to learn how to use the controls - they are not always intuitive! But I'm getting there and love the clean look of the electronic panel. The hob can be a little sensitive, turning everything off if there is a spillage. Overall, I'm delighted with this product.",Approved
Although I love this cooker it had to be returned on the first day as the clock/temperature control did not work. I had a temporary replacement from the dealer for 5 days then mine was returned. So far all seems to be working ok.,Approved
This oven is a delight to use. Very responsive and easy to operate. Looks great and not to noisy.,Approved

"So my previous washer dyer was a hotpoint and it was the loudest most temperamental thing i have ever owned. So when i bought the AEG and first used i, i wondered why i had waited so long! Yes the pump is abit loud but my kitchen and living room are adjoined and i don't have to alter the sound on my tv when its on so its not overly noisy just everything else is so quiet.   i have used the steam option on a dry clean only jacket and its come out perfect! I would recommend this as it looks smart and i cannot fault the washing or the drying. Also the drum is huge, can fit so much more washing in there!",Approved
"Great product, only has for a month but I have not found any issues! Reducing length of programme good feature! No criticism to date!",Approved
Noisy drum bearing very apparent during the first 2-3 hours of use. However the bearing seems to have settled down now and the dryer performs as expected. It remains to be seen whether this will have any long term effect.,Approved
"Inexpensive, good quality dryer that works well on automatic settings. Not too loud and has 3 venting position options. Impressed so far after 1st month. Like the guarantee / warranty.",Approved
This is an easy to operate machine with a large selection of programme choices and possibilities to modify some of those choices depending on your washload and intended finish. I have found an annoying squeak which stops after a period which I need to keep an eye on but the two years guarantee means I am not panicking yet!,Approved
"I love my washing machine! There I said it. After years of putting up with whatever we could afford when our washing machine broke down my husband and I decided to do some thorough research and invest in a washing machine that would a) last and b) make us happy. And we bought it before our other machine died so it wasn't a panic purchase. 

We have a young child and both work full time so a washing machine is pretty integral to our lives. The AEG OKO Mix model has transformed our lives in a number of ways. 
Firstly, we can do a wash whenever we like because the cycle is so quiet it won't wake us up. Previously, the only way we could cope with a wash is by leaving the house as our heads felt as if they were about to explode by the time our old washing machine finally screeched to a halt at the end of a cycle.

Secondly, this machine offers a LOT of choice about what type of wash you want. We tend to go for a standard wash dutifully separating our colours from our whites but there's really no need a s you can wash at such low temperatures you'd never have a colour run. I often wash shrinkable items at 20 degrees and haven't noticed any difference in the quality of the wash compared to a 40 degree cycle. 

The display clearly tells you how long each cycle will last and this is primarily determined by the weight of your clothes. A towel cycle will tend to take longer than a standard armful of clothes due to the weight and it really makes you think about how much you stuff into the machine. My husband uses different methods to me but I prefer a lighter load as the clothes fare much better and it's ready to hang out to dry much quicker! 

The super fast 20 minute wash is really handy but the steam wash is a revelation. The steam cycle refreshes clothes quickly so you don't require too much drying time but any odours are removed. The cycle is less than 15 minutes so really fast and it's hygienic - so it removes smells from your gym kit and is great for sports bras (but don't out your underwired bra in there because it will bend the wire in the heat). 

Yet another great plus point about this machine is that it mixes the washing detergent and the conditioner at the beginning of the process so you don't get any white streaks or remnants of washing powder / liquid on your clothes. My clothes definitely seem to be better taken care of in this washing machine too. They have held their colour well as well as looking as good as new after every wash. Clothes are less creased and smell amazing too. Essentially every element of clothing maintenance is taken care of by this excellent washing machine! Can't recommend it highly enough.",Approved
"Very unhappy with purchase, broke and not repairable after just 2 years. Would never buy again. Customer services offered no help.",Approved
"I am hugely impressed with the oven, I use it every day and it's 100% quicker than my old microwave. It's easy to clean and very easy to work.",Approved
"we are still learning abut this cooker it is not as fast as our old one, we had a tricty sovereign with halogen top.",Approved
Looks great with our matching oven nice to have retracting controls very smart,Approved
"Very happy with the oven. Looks good and bakes an excellent Victoria sandwich. 
We quickly got used to the controls.",Approved
Looks so nice and works well with lots of programmes to choose from haven’t really tested the self cleaning yet,Approved
"The product has good looks, and is functional. The hob is easy to control, but the grill function produces a patchy finish which is very disappointing.The two ovens overall are acceptable, but they operate at slightly cooler than I would have expected.",Approved
"I have not had time to try all the features of this cooker yet but so far I am really pleased with it. It looks good and is so easy to clean, no fiddly knobs to contend with! The touch controls are easy to use and the hob control is really good. Both ovens cook beautifully; I am still getting used to using the top oven to cook when only one shelf needed (my previous cooker top oven was not as efficient). Both ovens are really spacious and I am looking forward to trying the meat sensor. Very pleased with my purchase!",Approved
"It's unusual to have a grill in the lower oven as well as the top conventional oven that I'm sure we'll get to use eventually. For those of us that don't like sticky finger marks, its necessary to clean the very shiny ceramic top after every use. Overall though a nice design. Not tried all the available features yet but will try them out sometime.",Approved
"We have been using this new style AEG microwave combi-oven for the past few weeks in anger and getting used to its new settings and timings, as our old microwave had a revolving turntable so it is a little different. 
The change has been very easy and the controls are very easy to use and the results are very good in all respects.
The only down side has been that the light bulb in the microwave combi-oven was faulty after two weeks of use but all fixed now.",Approved
"Very good condition I loved it 
I told all my friends about this cooker",Approved

If I get to 2 year warranty and the AEG appliance has not broken I will be greatfull. As AEG customer services and contract repair company are awful. This is second AEG appliance to break within the 2year warranty there for I will not recommend AEG appliances. Unfortunately I own 4 appliances!,Approved
Do not like having to remove Shelf & Pan to use Microwave & Combi functions. Please confirm removal is necessary as some other makes e.g. Neff allows the Shelf to remain in position during theses functions.,Approved
"Much easier to use than expected, so many functions and the oven cooks nice and even.",Approved
test,Approved
Overall the washing machine is great and looks good. The only thing is you do need to use the steam function as the machine creases the clothes quite a bit even at 1000rpm. The time save is a very good extra to use as the cycles can be quite long otherwise. The stain option seems to work very well on a few occasions. My wife and daughter love to watch the jet of water from the Oko mix go in to the drum!,Approved
"After 3 weeks, I am still getting used to the very sensitive touch controls. It would be very useful if there was an index in the user manual as I spent some time trying to locate the minute timer, & still am not sure what the other timer does. I feel the cooker is may be over complicated for my needs & I have burnt my hand on the upper oven, not realising it was on. I find the beeping rather irritating every time I change something & the timer noise at the end of cooking is very faint, I could hear my old cooker's timer upstairs, this one is barely audible in the next room. I will definitely need to put the 'lock' on when my Grandchildren come. It is very easy to accidentally touch the controls without realising you have done so.",Approved

"I like this cooker very much it works just as discibed in the manual. A couple of anomolies I'm not sure about are firstly the grill function is not very good. The top heating element is so widely spaced that the grilling function doesn't work very wel as the food is not browned effectively. You also then need an oven glove to remove the tray as there is no handle. It's OK as a top oven. 
Secondly the in built temperature probe is extremely fiddly. You have to set it all up before you start. If you already have an external probe which you just need to stick into the meat you'll find that much easier to use.",Approved
"This product replaced a similar AEG integrated fridge/freezer of same dimensions and similar features, and so far has been excellent, particularly noticeable has been the electronic compressor which is very much quieter than the previous model (SCT71800S1) that it has replaced with same high standard of fitting and finish.",Approved
"I have recently acquired the new AEG 8000 series washing machine with the unique okomix technology,
This technology ensures all of detergent and softener is mixed with water dissolving and activating it completely before it even enters the drum. It’s the first washing machine technology ever to distribute detergents and softeners evenly,this is just one of many programme features available on this totally awesome washing machine.

As a mom with a large family including children under 10yrs old I especially liked the okopower
daily wash programme this gives you everything you need,washing clothes in only 59min with great results and less energy consumption.

Then there is the ProSense technology which automatically weighs each load to provide a tailored cycle. With sensors then adjusting washing times precisely, ensuring optimum treatment for all your clothes this also saves water and energy.

The 8000 series AEG washing machines use steam as a quick and easy way to refresh creased clothes so they’re ready to wear. The short, gentle steam programmes safely remove odours and reduce creases in dry fabrics. Or you can finish your wash cycle with a gentle steam so clothes need little to no ironing.

I am so pleased with my AEG L8FEC866R washing machine that I now want to add the AEG absolute care heat pump tumble dryer so I can dry my laundry regardless of the weather.",Approved
This is an excellent washing machine with many features. We particularly like the time save function which can be used on several different wash settings. You can also increase/decrease the temperature and spin speed. The steam function is perfect for items that just need a quick freshen up. Clothes come out spotless and smelling lovely,Approved
"Buying the combi was a great addition to my new kitchen. There are lots of features, from two levels of microwave, grill and fan assisted oven. The menu navigation took we a while to get to grips with but now I find it simple and easy to use after less than a month. Only problem I find is when using the microwave there is build up of condensation. So I don't know what problems this may bring in the future. For now I am wiping the interior down after each use.",Approved
"I purchased a combined microwave oven
The microwave is supplied without plate.
The seller told me that the microwave include new technology that the microwave doesn't need to rotate the plate because that wave scanning the food
Eventually, the microwave is not evenly heats the food, some burned, some remain frozen and some partial heats up
unfortunately unexpected that AEG marketing such a poor product",Rejected
Received as replacement for broken one. Love the design. Excellent lavazza coffee. All in all very pleased.,Approved
"As a woman in my early 70s this washing machine seemed technical and a little difficult to use on first impression. However once I read the manual which was easy to follow it is very easy to use and I love it. It looks stylish and I particularly like how quiet it is, had to keep checking it was still working during my first couple of washes!!",Approved
"Only been using this dryer for a couple of weeks but it dries everything so much better than my old one. So easy to use, just choose the setting, press start. Very little creasing hence ironing so much easier. Door operates well and emptying the fluff filter is really simple. Looks stylish and good quality too. Would highly recommend it.",Approved
"Really quiet, cleans well. Only a few cycles can have the larger loads but fantastic machine and well worth the extra money. Steam does make a bit of a difference in terms of reducing need to iron.",Approved
"Bought this Tumble Dryer a few weeks ago and it is quiet in operation, the water tank is easy to empty also is the fluff filter, very pleased with this machine.",Approved
"Love the look of the new machine, very quiet, love the steam function worth every penny, good build quality that you expect from AEG.",Approved
Had been looking for a coffee pod machine for some time and this one ticks almost all the boxes. Minor issue is the lack of temperature adjustment which is available on the + model. The + model was not available I n our colour choice of cream.,Approved
"Cant deny it - the fridge cools, and the freezer freezes. Perfection? Almost.

The fridge/freezer almost always has the fan on, so rarely is it completely silent. The glass shelves are a little flimsy - past fridges I have had the glass has felt toughened but these feel that if inadvertently dropped on the floor would shatter easily.

Time will tell.",Approved
"OKO 59 minute wash option helps me keep on top of all the laundry two young kids produce with other longer cycles to tackle tougher tasks. The machine has also done a great job on a delicate dress, a pair of grubby trainers and saved me from some last minute ironing with the steam setting. 

The large door makes it really easy to see what's going on in the machine, and get large items like bed sheets and towels in and out. The detergent drawer is also well designed making it easy to remove for cleaning. 

The control panel is clearly laid out and it is useful to see the weight limit for each setting as you select it, and have the machine tell you if you have exceeded this. My only criticism is the child lock can be a bit fiddly to switch on and off.",Approved
"Very good washing machine, with plenty of options. Easy to load and operate. Excellent spin needs less drying afterwards. Longer cycle time than previous make (Bosch) so yet to explore shorter cycle cleaning quality. Seems well built.",Approved

"Excellent washing machine. Lots of features to make washing easy. Like the fact you can reduce time on most of the settings and also change the spin time. Machine is extremely quiet. Solid, robust machine and another excellent product from AEG.  Would highly recommend this machine",Approved
Amazing machine. The dryer helps a lot. It takes care of the clothes,Approved
"This really is a clever washing machine and I’m extremely satisfied with the results. Our clothes look and feel so good. The machine is easy to use and the selection of programmes and settings perfectly wash all items of clothing, waterproof fabrics and duvets. Some of the useful options are delay start, plus steam, extra rinse and time save so you can adjust the washes to exactly what you need - what could be better. 

I’ve found that two outstanding features are the OKOPower programme and the Steam programme that visibly reduces creases. I’ve tried the Steam setting at the end of the washing programme and with dry clothes and it works so well. There is a visible difference which means little to no ironing. The OKOPower programme is brilliant, clothes are washed in 59 mins ensuring a good wash in a short time. I have had the machine a few weeks and I’m using this programme a lot with excellent results. There is a faster wash for once worn clothes perfect for when you are short on time but need good results 20min - 3kg. 

I love the wool/silk programme because I don’t have to hand wash delicate clothes and wool items, the machine does it for me and my clothes are kept in a good condition. There is an Aniti-Allergy wash which will also be handy. The machine has 9kg capacity, is front loading and so quiet even when spinning. You can tailor the settings on the machine and these include child lock, acoustic signals, permanent extra rinse and soft plus which improves fabric softness. This is an excellent washing machine and has made a difference to the look and feel of our clothes. I highly recommend this machine.",Approved
"Great size fridge freezer that for feeding our family of 4, quiet is operation and the fan function keeps food fresh",Approved
"Full disclosure: I was given this machine by AEg for review but my review below is honest and without any intervention from AEG.
 
I am generally a very sceptical person. Just because something costs more I do not expect it to give better results but I can appreciate quality when it is clear to see. Firstly this AEG washing machine gives off an air of quality. Perhaps it is perceived rather than real but the design and the materials do a good job of allaying any fears that you spent too much money on a washing machine. It even has touch controls on the front which plays to my geeky nature perfectly.
After I had finish patting myself on the back for having such a good looking piece of equipment in my laundry room I remembered that this is a washing machine and the true quality will only be known with the results of the wash.  Now there are  a lot of options and choosing the right one is the biggest problem I found. The instruction manual is ok but a better explanation of the purpose of each wash program would be appreciated, after all who wants to experiment in their clothes? Really?
Anyway, some of the programs seem a little more obvious and testing the OKOPower program was easy. Great result and quicker than normal. I cannot tell if the detergent mixed better than it has previously with my last machine but I was very happy. 
Next the steam program has helped with the ironing (not that i do it), my shirts really do seem to come out less creased! Also love the fact that I can steam an item that has has very light wear or has been hanging a while to freshen it up without having to do a complete wash.
Other than these, the low energy consumption is nice to know but doesn't really bother me on a daily basis and the other functions like cottons and synthetics will probably not get used as I am sure I will not bother to separate them.
One other thing that does good is the delicates and wool programs. No one wants to hand wash anymore and with these it seems I do not have to. Result!
Lastly we have two kids and 9kg load is essential.
I am very happy with the washing machine and do not see what more you could want from a washing machine. I recommend this highly.",Approved
"This is a great machine and i really like it. For anyone looking for energy saving this machine is for you, it weighs the wash before starting and adjusts the program and water usage before it starts. That saves me time and, water but also power - 3 big ticks for me. Its also quiet for a washing machine which is great. 

The controls are fairly simple to use and have a mix of 1 big control for the programs and touch screen for the fine tuning programs like temperature and speed. 

I got mine installed by the delivery team who were really friendly started the system up on its first run. All in a really good washing machine, economical and easy to use.

I've not been using it much as it doesn't pick up very well and spits the muck back out when you turn it off - I thought it had a two year warranty - just run out beginning of October - I am in contact with AEG direct as it should last longer than that - wish I'd been a bit more quicker off the mark in sorting it out.,Approved
"Once you get used to sorting by fabrics you will love this! It’s very quick. As long as you don’t mind airing everything off on a clothes dryer as the sensor stops before dry but I think that’s why you don’t need to iron as it doesn’t over dry! However you must take the clothes out immediately to achieve this or they will crease. I hated it at first but thought well I’ve got it now so need to work it out & I have & now love not ironing! The only downside is that say you dry clothes outside & just want to finish them off in a dryer it won’t as it thinks there dry,but I can live with that",Approved
"This is a great washing machine, its really easy to use, very straight forward and loads of different settings to choose from. Really quiet, so quiet in-fact you barely know its on! 

Would recommend to anyone looking for a new machine.

Simple enough for the children to operate - well they're young adults now, but they are actually doing their own washing now!  My son needed to do a quick wash to freshen up his footy kit - no problem - 3kg 20 min wash cycle.  Daughter needed a clean blouse for work as she had forgotten to get it in the main wash - steam refresh - job done! General cycle wash time adjusts based on the weight of the load, which is a nice feature.  There are a few buttons and also a touch sensitive screen to select all the options you may want.

"I have had this machine now for about 3 months.  I have to say that I LOVE IT.  This is a serious piece of kit, excellent sturdy build quality, no flimsy plastic to be found here. The confidence in the quality of the machine is reflected in the 5 year warranty. 
It is a 10kg machine and the drum is huge.  We are a busy family of 7 and this is a godsend.   I can fit in my Kingsize duvet, or two single (4.5tog) duvets in a single wash. Haven’t washed the winter duvets yet to comment on fit. The machine displays the weight of the washing as you put it in, which is great to prevent overloading, but to be fair most of the time I would have the washing machine ¾ full and it still weigh less than 10kg.  I personally like to leave a little extra space in the drum to make sure everything has space to move around. The time it takes for the wash to complete seems to be calculated on the wet weight of the wash, so the complete cycle time can change.  Generally my clothes washes take approximately 2 hours.  If I decide to fill the drum with loads of towels which hold a lot of water, the wash time is extended.  Very clever.  
The spin is unbelievably quiet and you would hardly know the wash is on, actually have to check if drum is turning.  I like the way I can tweak wash programs, change wash temperatures and spin speed, add extra time for stains, great for dealing with toddler messes.  
Another nice feature is when I start the wash, 20 seconds later, I spot a sock or something that I had dropped or forgotten.  By pressing the pause button, the door unlocks after a few seconds and allows me to put in the forgotten item, to be washed with the rest.
Delay button is great.  Delays in increments of 30 minutes.  Can load the washer the night before and can have it set to start in the morning.
My biggest annoyance with this machine is the position of the filter, at the bottom of the machine.  Now, only have to clean it every month or so, but I find it is too low to the ground and cannot get a shallow enough dish that will hold the quantity of water that comes out.  I just end up with a puddle on the floor.
Dryer function:  I think the best thing about the drying is that I do not have to empty any water from the dryer, it just goes out the water waste pipe. No more water spills trying to get the water container to the sink.  The dryer does make a quiet sort of chugging noise as it pumps out the water. Have a choice of functions here, you can manually select the length of drying or can use the auto function.  
Auto drying - this had me stumped for a while. It will give you a really long drying time, then after a minute or so turning the washing it will weigh the wet washing and adjust the time accordingly, much less than what it displayed at the start.  You can select from iron dry (slightly damp), cupboard dry and outside dry(sunny symbol).  I tend to use the cupboard dry, but found that when the timer went off, the washing continued to turn in the drum. I was able to remove the washing at this time, but it was seriously crumpled. After contact with AEG (customer service very helpful), I was informed that if I let the machine be, it would continue for a further 20minutes for cooling. Found this did reduce the crumpling a little, then noticed the “anti-crease” button.  Dried laundry now comes out great, ready to be folded and put away.  
There is an OKO program which is an all in one wash and dry.  Love this program but have to make sure that there is nothing going in to that wash that cannot handle the heat of the dryer.  I have destroyed a few plastic backed baby bibs that have sneaked in to the wash.  It’s great coming home after being out all day and your washing is washed and dried.
After drying have to make sure to remember to give the drum, door and rubber seal a quick wipe with a damp cloth to remove any fluff.  The drying function seems a little long, but it appears to be very gentle on the clothes as very little fluff comes off compared to conventional dryers.  But if you forget to wipe and do a dark wash, washing comes out all speckly, only make that mistake once.  
It is a 10kg washing machine with a 6kg dryer capacity, seemingly a common feature of washer dryers. I tend to pull out all the washing in to washing basket, remove anything that will not appreciate a tumble dry, and reload the machine under a wash cycle which will weigh the laundry, then set on to dry function.  This preventing overloading.  No real big deal here, as I would remove the laundry anyway. But it would be handy if the dryer function would display the weight of the wet washing also.
Cons: 	Lack of a quick wash program for very small quantities
Manual a little vague in places
Lack of weighing function in drying setting
Filter at bottom of machine awkward for draining.
Pros:	So many couldn’t possibly list them all, would be here all day.
	A great time saver
	Helpful customer service
	Top quality machine, thank you AEG.",Approved
"Overall the wash and dry cycles are great! It's very easy to choose the programme and see the weight, although the manual states the machine must be on before any washing is loaded for the weighing to work. I usually do separate wash and dry cycles but the combined programme is very useful.

I would have liked a feature my previous appliance had - a small tube to drain excess water from the filter so the filter can be taken out without water pouring out. I will have to tilt the appliance or use something to soak up the water to change the filter.

Secondly. the touchscreen is slow to respond when cycling through combined cotton wash / dry -> wash -> dry, although changing the dry time via the touchscreen is fine. I've found pressing once and waiting 10 seconds before pressing again is about all it can handle. The proper buttons to change the temperature and spin speed are great. Many other appliances fail here by making changing these key settings difficult, but not this one!

Lastly, the estimated time for a wash is difficult to understand. A normal wash starts at 1:07 but after the initial part of the wash it always increases to the correct time. I assume this is because of the weighing but cannot be sure. I also assume as the wash progresses the estimated finishing time changes but I haven't performed an exhaustive experiment. The ""quick wash"" button does seem to change the time. Confusingly, it can be pressed twice to alter the initial time from 1:07 -> 1:05 -> 1:04. Again the 1:05 and 1:04 will change once the wash starts to the actual time the wash will finish. I estimate the quickest wash to be around 40 minutes for an average load and the normal time 1hr 30 - 2hr 10 minutes. Knowing this makes operating the machine easier but I wish the appliance could just give an correct end time based on the wash settings.",Approved
Quality of washing up is very good. Quick wash is ok,Approved
"Excellent product.I have been using this machine for 3 weeks now.I used it for washing and drying.Quick and efficient less noisy than my old machines.Wash quality is much higher.

"Since getting this washer dryer I’ve been putting it to the test and it’s a really great machine – very user friendly!   Absolutely perfect for families with a 10kg wash load and 6kg dry load with my favourite 1600 rpm spin.  I love how quiet it is, and the large porthole makes it easy to load and unload the laundry and the LCD display is clear and easy to read, so makes it very easy to program.  

The selection of settings is vast allowing so many cycle variations – adjusting temperature & spin, anti-crease, anti-stain and prewash, quick wash, handwash woollens, steam programme – you’re truly spoilt for choice!  You’ve also got the choice of either time drying or auto drying.   The drying sensor will adjust drying times and keep you from wasting energy by over-drying laundry – it’s amazing!   There truly is a cycle for all house hold fabrics!  The delay feature is great.

What I love is pick your program and then put your washing in, and it tells you exactly how much the load weighs, so you can never overload it like I’ve done with bedding in the past!  It’s called ProSense® Technology, so it also adjusts the settings automatically to suit, which helps you save time, water and energy - as it’s A rated – thanks AEG!    It gives all your fabrics a thorough clean and cared for which is what you want, as it adjusts the drum movements via it’s intelligent DualSense™ Technology.  Cleaning performance is excellent.

I’d highly recommend this washer dryer – the wonders of modern technology – love it AEG!",Approved
"When it works, it's a really good machine but in less than a year it's had two call outs for two different faults while under warranty. To be fair, AEG have further extended the warranty. However, I'm not confident re the machine's ability to work consistently. Nowhere near as robust as my old Bosch. Ask me again at the end of year two.",Approved
"My first impression was that this was a high quality machine that is very careful with your cloths. However the USER MANUAL, while clear, looks a bit cheep and the glass door, while nice and big, is tinted which makes it hard to check if the washing is moving. We were disappointed that there was no 20 minute wash cycle - the quickest wash is over an hour.
The user guide mentions to clean the air filter but it does not show you where the air filter is an I have not found an air filter yet.
It seamed reasonably quiet for the first few washes, but now I would like a machine that was quieter during the spin cycle. The drying cycles seem to be very long and it is much quicker to take the washing out and put it in our conventional air blowing dryer.
The results on washing cashmere nit ware were very pleasing. The most loved feature is being able to quickly steam cloths to remove creases .
I was half expecting for the machine to ask me to joint the WIFI network  to that it could send data back to AEG so that they could do things like turn up with a new part just before it breaks.",Approved

"This machine is truly a  thing of beauty.  However, it performs better than it looks.! There's always something new to learn about the features of this wonderful machine. The other day I discovered it has 3 different quickwash settings rather than the standard one. This has been a real time saver when I am in a rush.  I have tried the drying function but to be honest I was disappointed with the results  until I realized  that I had put twice the weight in clothes as per the recommended  limit of 6kg. Unfortunately,  the machine isn't  as intelligent when it comes to dealing with humans who can't be bothered to read instructions.  I'm very happy with my magic box of tricks, if only it could do my ironing as well  then I would consider it an upgrade to my wife!",Approved
"This  machine looks very stylish in my  utility room, it's also quiet when in use , I hardly know  it's on!   I'm delighted at how well it washes and  am very happy with the final results.  It weighs your washing so you know  exactly how much detergent  to put in  and  it's easy to customize each wash at the touch of  a few buttons.  Just remember not to overload the dryer, so you achieve optimum results.  All in all a great machine from AEG .",Approved
Superb cleaning. Outdoor cycle is fab. Drying good,Approved
"Overall the machine is well designed for integration into kitchen cabinets. Functions are all sensible and the controls easy to use. However, I bought this machine on the basis of the AEG quality reputation and unfortunately it broke down after only three weeks and needed a new ventilator unit for the dryer which was disappointing to say the least, repair was fast and easy but just the same my faith in AEG has been shaken.",Approved

"Our machine is just over a year old and can honestly say it has been the worst washer dryer we have ever had.  Since we had this installed in our new kitchen we have had nothing but trouble and have called out service repair many times.  Amongst many of the issues these include the heating element had gone in less than a year and now the drum bearings have gone and we have booked a major repair where they replace bearings etc.  It's never ending and every time it breaks down, we are having to have service washes and spending at least £50 a week.  We are not impressed and will officially complain to AEG as we feel our machine is not fit for purpose.",Approved
"This a great , well built machine very quiet, balanced drum, and a very good drying action",Approved
"This machine is fantastic! I've had it for nearly a year now and cannot fault it in any way. Clothes come out like new consistently, there are lots of programs and I have used them all. The wash load of 9KG is great along with the 6KG dry load. Auto shut off once you cycle has ended, being able to decrease spin speed along with temperature settings on each wash cycle. The machine is so intelligent it reduces the cycle time from the max dependant on weight, which is great as it saves loads of energy, water and time. The dryer is incredible, I use the Auto Dry but only ever need to use the 2nd setting (store dry), as everything comes out bone dry and nice and soft. The dryer is just like having a seperate condenser dryer, you have the various settings, cottons, synthetics, wool etc along with Auto Dry X3 settings, and a wash & dry setting with a generous load size. Garments always come out like new too, even delecates. Having had washer dryers for many years I know that they always work well for the first few months then drying times start to increase slightly, this is due to the fluff collecting in a plastic container inside the machine by the motor so you can't clean it out! However, this is not the case with this machine as the fluff gets collected in the tray above the detergent tray, so drying times are always consistent. I think this is the BEST washer dryer on the market at present, it dies everything the manufacturer states and dies it consistently. I looked at loads of washer dryers from every other company including other washer dryers from AEG and researched them before buying this one. This is the most expensive machine by far but worth every penny, it is light years ahead of its competitors with the heat pump technology, which is great as it cuts energy bills, the fluff collection  box for the dryer, all the advanced settings such as sensing the wash load and adjusting times, adjusting the dry time by sensing how dry your clothes or sheets are, and all the other programs that go with it. 
Note: since having this machine our electricity bill has reduced slightly, this is ""I think"" due to shorter wash & dry times and probably the heat pump. We have used the dryer on the dryer a lot more on this machine than our previous machine, and I've looked at energy bills for 2015/16 when we had our old AEG washer dryer and 2016/17 period with the new machine. 
The only downside to this product for most customers  is the height, it is taller than any other washer dryer so you cannot fit it under most counter tops, the height is purely down to the fluff collection box. I do t see this as a massive problem though. 
I highly recommend this product.",Approved

View summary sorry not long enough sorry not long enough,Approved
Have had this machine for a few weeks now and still finding new functions to try out. Has provided excellent results so far. Very quiet with little vibration so can be used at night without waking up the family. Long washes are very long so have mainly used short or medium but results on these are very good. If you have not used touch sensitive buttons before you may take a little time to get used to them. All in all an excellent machine.,Approved
"Great Machine, easy instructions. You will need a pack of dish washer salt to get the best results. Nice and quiet, even a sounder when the cycle ends which is handy when you are working busy at home. The 20min quick wash is just great when you are in a hurry. The items come out very soft compared to other machines i have had.  I would and have  recommended the machine to our families and friends.",Approved
"Had this machine delivered direct from AEG & the delivery experience was really good. I was kept informed with delivery updates, it arrived when I expected it to & installed/tested. Took a little time to test as the guys didn't realise that salt needed to be added before the machine can be used but a quick check of the installation manual resolved this.

The very first wash cycle I tested was problematic. A woollen item which is labelled as recommended dry clean which I had previously washed in other machines shrunk so I was disappointed with this & unsure if it was a machine fault or not. AEG sent an engineer out to fully test the appliance & no errors found. This was resolved to a fully satisfactory manner by AEG customer care. However, I will not be washing any items that I previously was able to wash that are recommended for dry cleaning.

Generally the machine is great & after the initial hiccup I have been experimenting with the different wash cycles. I especially love the steam feature which has pretty much eliminated the use of my iron.

The machine does take some time running normal wash cycles but given the triple A rating that's to be expected. There is a quick wash program for when I'm in a hurry but I generally use the normal programs with the delay timer to time the end of the wash shortly after I get home from work so I can unload the machine & avoid leaving laundry inside for any period of time to get wrinkled.

Given all the fabulous features of this machine, I think the only thing missing is the new technology available in other machines that determines the amount of detergent to use.

In summary it's a great machine, has lovely features, it's the quietest machine I've ever owned. Customer service has been good & it comes with a 5 year warranty. I think it's excellent value for money in the long run.",Approved

Choose the Eco setting for your standard wash. Pressed for time or only have a small load? The Time Save option lets you shorten most of the programmes. Creasing was virtually eradicated when I added Steam to the end of my wash, or simply make use of the Rinse Hold function. We used the Steam function on it's own as well to freshen up some shirts that had only been worn for a few hours but were pretty creased - totally freshened them up for wearing again in only about 15 minutes.

"I took delivery of my new machine 3 days ago. so this first review is based upon my first impressions as I haven't used all the wash cycles yet. 
The appearance of the machine is one of understated elegance (think of an Apple Iphone),  The classy brushed alloy cover on the detergent dispenser tray sits beautifully alongside a very simple programme dial and easy to read touch screen display.  The front loader door has a nice dark inset which supports an overall impression of an expensive and well built machine. The control panel layout and programme dial is intuitive to the user (even for a guy).
The first wash - mixed coloured cotton - 60 deg C  was followed by steam cycle ... could I really get away with less ironing ??  
At first I thought there was a fault or I had done something wrong as there was none of the usual noises coming from the utility room.. a quick look confirmed that the wash was indeed going through its cycle, this really is the quietest machine I have ever used, my mum would love it !, it also became apparent that there appeared to be more soap bubbles in the drum and yet the amount of detergent used was less than my old machine, the soft water technology clearly giving rise to more bubbles. At the end of the cotton wash cycle some 3 and a bit hours later , I tried the steam cycle and bingo .. exactly what I wanted .. less creases meant in most cases I didn't even need to iron and where I did iron it was much easier .. so in a nutshell I'm super impressed with my new machine, the only shame is that it's in my utility room... it's pretty enough and yes quite enough to go in my living room ... well done AEG",Approved
"One niggle to start. After the installers had left I discovered they hadn’t attached the noise limiters underneath. This meant pulling out and tipping the machine ourselves to fix them in place.
This machine replaced another from AEG so what I wanted to know was whether all these new features would make a real difference to my washing. I very quickly discovered that they do.
I love the built-in water softener. It’s very easy to set up and easier to fill with salt than my dishwasher. I only like to use the minimum amount of washing liquid and softener out of concern for the environment but now I’m experimenting with using even less as none of it is needed to soften the water.
My water isn’t very hard but even so I notice the washing water is foamier and clothes come out very noticeably softer than before. That’s everything, from socks and jeans to towels and sheets.
The default time on many of the programmes seems long but I seldom have very dirty clothes to wash so I often use the time save option. Pressing it twice can bring the time right down. I’ve also found the delay start feature handy.  I can set a load of washing ready last thing at night and it’s just finished and ready to dry when I get up in the morning. Much better than staying wet in the machine most of the night, less creases too.
The OKOPower wash came into its own when I did my family’s holiday washing. There must have been at least a dozen loads and with each one only taking around an hour it was all done in a remarkably short time compared to using a traditional programme. I don’t know how it manages to wash so thoroughly in such a short time but it certainly did.
And then there’s the steam option. If I use this on my husband’s casual shirts, either at the end of the wash or after they’ve been dried I can just hang them up for an hour and they don’t need ironing! The same goes for duvet covers. I wish this programme had been available when my children were at school – for all those blouses and shirts every week.
I was a bit disappointed with the ProSense load detection function. A previous AEG washing machine showed the weight as items were added. This gave you the confidence to do full loads. This function may well do other wizzy things during the wash but it doesn’t give an actual weight. You have to stay by the machine too after you’ve started the programme just to see if you get the flashing overload indicator. If you do, I’m not sure how you tell how much should ideally be removed? This function needs more work AEG to be really useful to me.
Overall though, this is a stunning, high quality washing machine and definitely the best one I’ve ever had.",Approved
"This has got to be the best washing machine I ever owned. Colours remained intact, and there's hardly any need to iron my clothes when they come out. I am perfectly satisfied",Rejected

"This machine replaced an older more basic AEG front loader and; wow. The machine is easy to use and cleans exceptionally well. Excellent capacity, very high speed spin without being too loud and support for many fabric types. The ability to change and customise the wash program along with built in scale and water-softener mean clothes are clean every time, in as little time as possible. As an outdoorsy person I especially like the technical DWR cycle for treating outdoor fabrics. We are a large family, so the 9kg capacity is put to the test with our children's hard wear and tear on their clothes.

The pre-wet and softener mean better cleaning without being harsh on the darks.

"The machine is high-quality and modern. The build quality is excellent and the machine is very sturdy and solid. Its 9kg drum capacity is great for our family of four, and is A+++ energy rating is great for me, the bill payer.

It’s really simple to use, navigating through the programmes is done with a single dial. You can also then customise the programmes with options to change the temperature and spin speed, etc.

There’s an option to shorten the durations of a cycle, which I’ve found useful for normal/lightly soiled laundry if I’m in a rush. There is also an Eco option, which saves energy by decreasing the programme temperature and extending the washing time, which I use when time isn’t an issue.

You can even add a steam function at the end of a programme; this noticeable reduces the creases in the washing and makes ironing much easier, which I’m a huge fan of.

All the information is displayed on the big, bright display which is very clear and easy to understand.

The detergent drawer is also easy to remove for cleaning, although a little stiff to pull out.

The combination of the “OkoMix” and “Soft Water technology” makes a noticeable improvement from our last machine. Our washing is much softer and smells wonderful. The smell of the fabric conditioner is much more evident and lasts far longer. I’m also washing at much lower temperatures than previously and getting better results.

I haven’t used all the programmes on the machine as yet; I use the OKOPower programme a lot. It’s great for removing stains from my son’s cricket whites. The wash takes just under an hour which is ideal as it’s quickly ready for his next game.

The 20 minute programme is fantastic for freshening up my daughter’s school uniform, removing all visible stains.

The anti-allergy wash is also a favourite. My daughter and I both have allergies, and I’ve used this programme for towels and bed linen as it helps remove pollen and other allergens, as well as germs and bacteria.

The washing machine also has a great steam programme which I’ve used more than I thought I would. It’s great to refresh clothes without having to rewash them, and everything comes out relatively crease free making them much easier to iron.

The washing machine is also amazingly quiet, even when spinning. It is by far the quietest machine I’ve ever owned. It’s so quiet that I’ve had to go and check it’s still working on several occasions.

This is an excellent washing machine, perfect for our family, and it also comes with a 5-year warranty. Brilliant.",Approved

"With a 10 month old baby in the house our washing machine seems to be constantly on the go. We received this machine just as our baby was moving into her 9 - 12 month clothes so it has been well tested over the last 6 weeks on old and new clothes alike.
We cannot believe how well this machine preserves new fabrics. We were slightly sceptical about the softwater technology feature as we don't live in a very hardwater area but the difference it has made to our laundry is incredible. Our baby's vests and sleepsuits look and feel just as good as when they were new out of the packet.
We also love how wonderful our laundry smells coming out of the machine now. We think this is down to the okomix feature that means that every drop of detergent and conditioner is used as it is diluted with water before reaching the laundry.  The laundry smells of fabric conditioner much longer than with our previous machine which means the clothes feel fresher for longer.
We keep the machine in our kitchen so the look of the machine and noise level were important factors for us. The machine looks modern sleek and we can't quite believe how quiet it is, even on a spin cycle it is extremely quiet.
One of our favourite features is the delayed start. This allows us to wake up in the morning to a load of laundry that has already been washed so we can really make the most of outside drying on sunny days. Another extremely useful feature is the 20minute 3kg cycle, we use this frequently to wash baby's plastic long sleeve bibs at the end of a day and it works a treat. It's also useful if you want to wash something straight away to avoid a stain setting in but don't have other similar items for a full load.
The steam function is so useful for refreshing clothes that have been in the drawer for a little too long but do not require a full wash, the steam cycle is just perfect for an instant refresh.
It's really hard to believe that a machine with so many features has a better than A+++ energy rating and of course it weighs each load to ensure only the required amount of water is used so we're saving on energy and water bills too!
We would highly recommend this machine.",Approved
"This washing machine is extremely quiet whilst offering a range of programmes that suits all washing types from a quick steam to remove wrinkles from a shirt through to a full cotton wash.  The OKOpower programme is particularly effective and provides outstanding results. 
The only small negative we have found is the quality of the plastics used in the detergent tray as they feel slightly flimsy for a machine of this price.  All in all a fantastic product",Approved
It's very quite very well made looks good and washed excellent ... so did I make the right choice ..... definitely,Approved
"Probably the best washing machine I have ever owned. So far very impressed with the results. The water softener is a great feature, the reason I purchased this machine and ensures all the clothes are washed perfect.
i would defiantly recommend this machine.",Approved
"Really nice to be able to have an excellent coffee at home whenever.
The machine is quick and unfussy, the coffee is delicious.
I wish I'd bought one years ago,",Approved
"I'll start by saying that I absolutely love this machine. It is beautiful to look at and I have received lots of compliments on it. It's well made. You can tell it will stand the test of time. Even the delivery man said AEG are one of the strongest washing machines he's come across. 
It has 10 different programs. As a family of 6 including 2 toddlers we wash clothes daily. We have noticed a big difference since using this machine. We love the 20 minutes 3kg wash. Its very useful for when we need to wash a few clothes very quickly. It has Prosense technology. It weighs your clothes and increases or decreases the time it needs to wash for. Our favourite cycle that we use daily is the OKOPower programme. It lets us wash our daily clothes thoroughly and quickly in just 59 minutes. The children have sensitive skin  so we use the option of adding an additional rinse cycle to make sure all the detergent is really out. We use the steam setting whilst washing the bed linens, it reduces the amount of creases so there is less ironing afterwards. The steam setting is also good if you want to refresh clothing or linens.
We usually put the washing machine on a night using the time delay feature. The machine is so quiet it wont disturb your sleep at all. The internal drum light is very helpful, it's so bright. You can load the machine without turning on the kitchen lights! If i do wash the clothes during the day we put on the child lock to stop the kids messing with the machine.
This washing machine will look after your clothes because of its soft water technology. They come out softer and the colours wont fade. We have a smart meter in our house and we tested this machine, it uses very little energy.",Rejected
"Our last AEG 3kW Condenser Tumble Drier was used regularly and lasted about 12 years until it had a failed motor so decided on this product particularly because it used a Heat Pump System as a heat source and hence used less energy and power consumption. So, instead of 3kW, it uses just 900W. We can run now the Drier from our solar panels for free! The Drier has a very good, informative display and many useful programmes. It runs quietly, has a light in the drum, which is very helpful and it takes a good load. We highly recommend this product.",Approved
This is replacement for a previous model which I loved and it has taken no time for me to love this one even more!!,Approved
"Really like the range of cycles! Gets clothes really clean, even on the quick washes! So far no complaints!",Approved
I am finding this microwave oven a very useful addition to our kitchen. Great features.,Approved
"We had this washing machine delivered a few weeks ago and so far we've been very impressed.
To put it into context, it replaced an integrated washing machine that was both noisy and had a relatively small drum. We didn't want another integrated machine for this reason and, although this machine sticks out a bit, it's no worse than the facia door on the integrated machine.
This machine is much quieter than our previous machine, although we were a bit miffed that the installers did not fit the sound barriers to the underneath of the machine before installation. Make sure whoever installs the machine know about these as they are not a common feature of washing machines and are likely to be left off.
The main features that we are impressed with:
Large capacity - 9kg.
20 minute programme - great time saver for small loads.
OKOPower - one hour programme seems to suit most other washes we want to do and is nice and quick.
Temperature changer - seems to have more flexibility than previous machines.
Time save - you can easily shorten a longer programme using this feature which we like.
Water softener - softens water with salt as per a dishwasher which appears to work well based on the extra softness of the washed items.
Steam phase - possibly out favourite setting, which we have been using for sheets as you hang them up straight away and there's no need to iron them.
Overall an excellent machine which is used on average three times a day in our house and I'm sure we'll find out more features in the weeks/months/years ahead.",Approved
"Me and my wife have recently upgraded our washer to an AEG L9FSC969R, this is an amazing appliance, the washing machine is probably the most used appliance in the home and we wanted it to be economical to use but also very effective. This model is just incredible, honestly, it washes your clothes beautifully, most machines leave a residue of detergent on your textiles , the reason I say this is because having used this machine, in comparison to my previous high end
Washer ,it leaves your clothes totally clean and free of excess soap, if you follow the simple instructions it makes your clothes/towels/bedding gorgeously clean and lovely against your skin. Also the water softener means that my clothes seem to be holding the colour more, I.e polo shirts I have aren't wearing around the collar as they usually would and are keeping the colour more. This washer is the real deal and we honestly love it, and can't recommend enough.",Approved
"I really am thrilled with my new washing machine - it's so quiet, even at the top spin speed and the range of programmes means I can get exactly what I need.

I do a lot of sports, so being able to either choose a quick 20min wash or a full specialist sports-wear wash cycle is ideal.

I anticipate that the load-sensor will have a positive effect on my water bills, and electricity as this is a triple A-rated machine.

All in all very happy thus far.",Approved
"I have always heated cleaing the oven after my wife's experiments. This was one of the reasons why I chose this AEG oven because it does self cleaning. So far, so good. Haven't needed to get my hands dirty so far as it burned off everything the wife left behind",Approved

I have been  using this machine for a few days now and I am really impressed with the performance the machine has many features and is very quiet when on a cycle the 1600 rpm spin is amazing the clothes come out well spun this reduces drying time a lot the new oko mix technology  is brilliant as it pre mixes the detergent before it enters the machine this washes the clothes the better removes stains well and leaves the clothes looking and smelling fresh the stem wash function is  also  a brilliant feature as it reduces ironing time dramatically  I would recommend only doing half loads with this function to achieve maximum results the wash times might seem quite long at first but the machine weighs the load and reduces the cycle time to adjust to the wash load if this  feature  don't please  there is also a time save button which can reduce the time further I would recommend this machine to everyone  as it is incredibly economical whilst still giving maximum results to your washing,Approved
"AEG asked me if I would review their top of the range L9FSC969R washing machine and I was only glad to oblige.

If, like me, you’re keen to research a major purchase such as a kitchen appliance like this, you’ll no doubt be aware that AEG have a good reputation in this regard. I did this with the purchase of my previous machine and chose AEG then.

So what’s there to get so excited about with this product? Lots!

First off, it looks impressive - great modern design, exceptional build quality and it’s reassuringly heavy and sturdy. The door mechanism is very good - sturdy yet very easy to use. The delivery drivers commented on the quality of the materials used in this product as they were installing it (and they weren’t employed by AEG)

The controls are very easy to use and the selection of programmes available is comprehensive and actually useful - so many times there seems to be a million different programmes available of which only one is ever used. That’s certainly not the case here.

The machine is SO quiet when in normal use - even when spinning at 1600rpm with a full 9kg load it is by far the quietest machine I’ve ever used.

Visibility into the drum is excellent, both when loading / unloading due to the bright internal LED light and during the wash programme. The drum is large which makes it easy to load and unload a full 9kg of washing.

The steam programmes. Wow! What a difference this makes to the ironing. Whether you use the steam to re-fresh or de-crease clothes, or add a steam cycle to the end of a wash programme - this REALLY makes a significant difference to how much ironing (one of my pet hates) is required. Using the steam programme in isolation means I get an extra days wear out of all of my work shirts which is a HUGE bonus - I would never go back to a machine without this functionality.

This machine has a built in water softener - great for use in hard water areas. Soft water not only gets you better cleaning performance with much less detergent, but should also prolong the life of the machine. It will also mean clothes look better for longer too.

This particular model comes with a feature that AEG call “OKOMIX” - this mixes the water and detergent, or water and fabric softener BEFORE entering the drum - this should ensure that the detergent and softener is distributed evenly through the wash for a better cleaning performance.

I’ve found the cleaning and spin performance to be exceptional. The “OKOPower” programme appears to clean normally soiled clothes exceptionally well in under an hour - far, far better than any other shortened programme I’ve used on other machines.

Also, after the 1600rpm spin the clothes are significantly drier than other machines I’ve used too.

There are lots of other functions on the machine that are extremely useful, but I believe I’ve covered the main ones here. I would definitely recommend this product, and wouldn’t look anywhere else if I had to replace my machine today.",Approved

"Having owned a pair of AEG fridge and freezer for 10 years, it was the natural choice when the old freezer gave up. Not being able to match the previous models I opted for the largest available. The draws on runners are a great improvement over the old style slides. The only real criticisms are that the 2nd compartment down is a draw not a flap, at 6ft I have to tip toe to see in it. The other is that it is noisy at times (only noticeable in a silent room but open plan areas will be effected), probably part of the frost free feature, but I'd always assumed freezers were silent now.",Approved
Baskets are on metal runners which puts less stress on the plastic drawers. There are glass shelves above the drawers giving space for air to circulate which is an improvement on my old model. The built in light is useful too. I hope this model lasts longer than the six years of the previous one.,Approved

Chills and freezes well, already I can see how fresh my food stays for longer clever climate adjustment between the fridge and freezer. 
Slight downside to this product would be plastic door handles which takes from a high spec product.",Approved

"Great little undercounter freezer, holds plenty and drawers go right back. Only drawback is it’s not frost free, otherwise it would have been 5 stars.",Approved
Overall we are pleased with this freezer. There are very few of this specification to choose from on the market. It is quiet running an being frost free is boon . Only criticism is that its capacity is some 10% less than the freezer it replaced but this seems to be common amongst other few similar products on the market,Approved
I was really pleased with my unit however at less than 3 years old it's developed a none repairable fault. I wish I'd bought a cheaper brand!,Approved
"We wanted to purchase a simple to use but good quality machine and this model fitted the bill perfectly. The energy use is very competitive and while this does mean longer cycle times there is an option to reduce these if you wish. 

The only negative from my wife is that she feels the power button doesn't have a very confident action (it doesn't click or push in fully) to it but time will tell if this becomes a problem or not.",Approved
A bright modern fridge freezer with keypad touch technology. Love the frost free freezer. The bright lighting and ease of moving drawers and holders on door to suit heights required are wonderful. Delighted I bought mine almost 5 years ago and never had problem with it. Thsnk you AEG :),Approved
"The function of this product is good, when it's working. It has had its freezer defrost coil replaced 3 times and it has just started to alarm again. This product has not been fully tested before sale. We will not buy a replacement from AEG Electrolux. I worked for Elux for a number of years in R & D we would not have released a defective product like this.",Approved
"Found this to be a great value vacuum cleaner. It's light and compact and easy to store in the cupboard. Ideal for homes with less floorspace. It has a surprisingly powerful motor and I am always confident it will clean well. Being a more compact model, it requires emptying more often than other models I've owned but this is a price worth paying for the value of its other features. In no particular order I would summarise it's strengths as:
Compact and light
Powerful cleaning
Generous reach of both cable and hose
Easy to maintain (filters etc)
Sturdy design",Approved
This is our third machine within two months. The washing machine has a steam function which didn’t work on the first two models despite five visits from the engineer and a review of our plumbing / stand pipe etc. We ended up getting a higher spec machine and it works brilliantly.,Approved

Very fed up, have spent over an hour on the phone today.",Rejected

Nice interior to it but gurgles and hisses lots of low noises,Approved
"Very easy to use & love the fact that the smaller oven is st the top as this is the main one I use.
Was a little disappointed that it was narrower than my old oven, had to go out & buy new cooking pans which was a disappointing as I had only just brought new ones at Christmas.",Approved
"I wanted this one to match and align in between 2 full height ovens. Its really hard to use as a microwave, hard to program a time quickly compared to a cheap basic microwave.

As a small fan oven its great.

Not enough practical information on how to combine microwave and fan cooking together.

No turntable hence the microwaved food is occasionally overdone on one side compared to the other.

Quite a noisy fan that operates for some time after use.",Approved

"Having made the transition from a relatively new machine from a different brand, I am so pleased that I have managed to find a machine where one can actually give laundry a thorough wash without it taking several hours to complete a cycle. The machine is solid, quiet and extremely stable when spinning even on unbalanced loads. Laundry is washed thoroughly but because the laundry isn't washed for three hours and then some, the difference in the feel of the laundry is immediately noticeable. Fabrics are soft to touch and signs of fabric wear on cottons has been halted from the deterioration caused by my previous machine. The spin drying efficiency is up there with the best, and surprisingly effective even on the cycles for man made fibres.",Approved
"Great looking fridge freezer . Keeps everything as it should , but very noisy . I am really dissapointed as I have other appliances by segment which are excellent .",Approved
"I do not like this fridge freezer at all, very poor quality and it is very noisy.",Approved
Used it a few times and very good so far does a very good job. Well made should last for a year or too.,Approved
Not had a washing machine ever in 30 years as good as this. Whites come up white finally a machine that does what the manufacturers claim. Use almost third less cup of soap powder n third less softner. Smells better than what my previously two others did . Sits silent too with vibrations reduced by half of previous machines.,Approved
"Very disapointed and regret buying this machine.
When I did my first wash, I was waiting for it to finish - expecting to hear a finish tone - no noise was emitted.
I found that Acoustic Signals could be turned on / off - I turned them on - still no signal.
An engineer came out and after an hour told me it was working - just VERY QUIET.
The only way to hear it is to be right next to the machine - the signal is quieter than the machine !!!
This is no good to me as when I have a number of loads to do, I need to know when the cycle has finished.
An expensive machine that is spoilt by such a simple thing.",Approved
"My coffee machine sat on top of my old washing machine and the vibration of the washing machine often cost me a cup or two. I cannot believe how quite and stable my new AEG is, no noise or vibration when washing or on full spin. The Functions that are now included are all time savers, like it weighs the wash and the wash time is then calculated, Clever. Washing machines seem to last with me for 8 to 10 years, so when replacing one would like to think you are future proofing yourself to some point, if that is possible. With the internet to do all the research and to get even more confused, asking a washing machine engineer his opinion was the clincher, washing has become a pleasure again.",Approved
"Wonderful couldn’t ask for anything better , good lighting and plenty of room, in fridge and freezer, thoroughly recommend it.",Approved
"Apart from the very poor AEG delivery timings, which was no fault of the distributor, we have been pleased with the appliance.",Approved
"Great fridge, everything at the right level. just what I wanted.",Approved
"When giving this product a deep clean I found it almost impossible to get the middle fridge drawer back in then I had to take everything out again as I had put the wrong glass shelf under it so that means every shelf on the door too, do the designers not realise the door doesn't open far when it has a cupboard door attached, the bottom two fridge drawers pull the shelf out when opened and you have to remove the drawer on the door opening side to slide the next one along to pull it out I have to climb on steps to see the controls which are complicated , whoever designed this needs firing. The only good thing is it does a good job but it won't be getting another deep clean in a hurry.",Approved
"We found the upgraded unit is every bit as efficient as our previous model, the appearance is pleasing to the eye. The controls are not complicated and very responsive.
The unit does not look clumsy or over fussy.
Simple clean lines, finish is quality.
just the right amount of chrome, that does not distract from the polished finish.
Cooking response is quick and efficient",Approved
"Purchased this when we moved from a house with an integral oven and hob. No regrets what so ever. It looks good, performs well and is a lot quieter than our old built in fan oven. The induction hob seems to cool down quickly after use which Is ideal with children in the house. The only gripe would be how easy it is to scratch the hob glass, care must be taken to lift pans and not slide or rotate them on the hob.",Approved
"Purchased this fridge freezer from Wickes.  Contacted Wickes as did not hold temperature.  Wickes didn't want to know and passed me to AEG.  AEG instructed an engineer on two occasions to repair or should I say replace parts.  Not satisfied, I contacted AEG again who then instructed an engineers report.  The engineer put a thermometer in the fridge and then the freezer for several minutes and reported to AEG that the temperature was within tolerance.  How, in a few minutes, that can be a good result I don't know.  Food has been spoilt and had to be disposed of.  AEG refused to do a longer test that I requested but suggested I go back on the merry-go-round to Wickes.  Would I recommend this product,   Definitely NOT it is excessively noisy and this one will be going just as soon as I can afford something better- definitely not from Wickes or AEG",Rejected

"I bought a very similar product HAF not VAF in the spring, and now the kitchen is completed, it is quiet noisy.
When the service engineer came to look at the problem, he confirmed that it had been installed correctly and said it was quite normal! Even though there is a AEG freezer next to it, no doubt with similar heat exchange and pumping mechanism operating pleasantly quietly..
When asked for a review from the company by email in August, I told them about the issue again. 
Nothing happened.

Very cool refrigerator which is very useful for a single room use. I took one for my single use. It has enough storage compared to other refrigerators like this,Approved
"Bought this to replace an undercounter larder fridge which we found always full and hard to find stuff in, even though it’s just the 2 of us. It’s great now being able to see everything that’s in it, and get what we want often without stooping. The fruit and veg storage is substantial and the roller drawer is good. Also like the roller feature which allows for easy pulling out the unit to clean under it. Haven’t really explored some of the extra features like holiday mode, but I’m sure they will be useful to some.",Approved
A very well made article but feel the instruction book could be set outout better with more information on use.,Approved
"Does exactly what it is supposed to, keeps thing cold. Well thought out internally with a good variety of shelf positions.",Approved
Nice simple to use cordless vacuum no fancy exras but does what it is supposed to,Approved
"Delivered with no shelves, took over a week to get the correct ones. Disappointed with AEG quality control, same with oven delivered without shelf runners.",Approved
Accessibility very good. Purchasing separate plastic storage containers makes storage easier. Good spacing between trays. Door storage lids good idea and prevent items falling out when door opened. Overall quality excellent.,Approved
Gives lots more storage space than my previous under the counter fridge but with the same footprint. I particularly like the sturdy adjustable shelves and the very quiet motor.,Approved
"Overall,I am delighted with this fridge freezer.
Love it's stylish looks and features.
However in these times of recent appliance fires, I would have expected that the back would have been metal. Hence the markdown in stars for design.",Approved
Great design and build quality at a very reasonable price. We found the oven easy to use,Approved
Really easy to use and easy to clean down after each use,Approved
"Washing machines have to do more than the basics these days, and this is a machine to get in a spin about. The choice of settings is wide to include , for example, a useful duvet setting. This AEG calculates the weight of your load and adjusts settings such as time to fit. You can opt for Eco settings to reduce water use and the time a program takes: this helps because the standard settings can be a little lengthy, to be honest. I am just investigating the useful steam feature and so far work shirts are emerging needing less ironing, always a bonus. Finally, need a quiet machine? This AEG will surprise you with its low decibel count.",Approved
Wasnt sure of the reviews i read but you just adjust the time of cycle its a great machine my 3rd aeg i wouldn't buy any other make,Approved
"So quiet and still, I hardly notice it is on. The range of functions is perfect for every need.",Approved
"Awful Customer Service once they have received your money you are forgotten about.
 All that has happened to me is I've been passed from one person to another to another & another 
Passing the buck 
Awful terrible I hate it 
Never never again 
VERY very Poor Service for the amount I spent on a TOP END Appliance :(((((",Rejected
"Love this washing machine. So quiet when in use and has a wide range of cycles. Extra large drum door also a great feature.
Some of the cycles are quite long but the time required for drying is greatly reduced as the clothes come out practically dry. 
One small downside, as discovered by my 2 year old, when the child lock is on, the on/off button is still active",Approved
I had my last AEG washing machine for nearly 20 years and was very sad when we had to say goodbye. Needless to say I was determined to stick with AEG and can only say that I absolutely love my new machine! It is so beautifully quiet and the 20 minute wash is an absolutely Godsend. The 1600 spin cycle ensures an almost dry result. Everything about it says 'quality'. Well done AEG!!,Approved
Really quiet and easy to load and empty features are good and simply feels like a quality product. We have yet to try the steam function but cannot fault this machine.,Approved
"We had a Miele which was trouble free, we are sure that the aeg will be as good",Approved
"Setup, first use is sorted in a few minutes. Controls and programs well though out so no issues in choosing which one you need. No more worries about overloading as machine lets you know is you have put to much washing in.
And here's the best thing about the washer for me, it is so quiet.",Approved
Very pleased with this product. Easy to use and great results .,Approved
"I find this product very handy, lightweight and powerful.
But I don't think the cutter works very well, my daughter has long hair and I still find myself using scissors and picking it out - so a bit disappointed there.
Also the metal wire piece under the foot keeps coming undone.
It picks up well on wood, tiles and carpet, so much better than a heavy hoover.",Approved
"Very nice cooker, took a while to get to know controls but very easy to operate. Settings via touchpad so no fiddly knobs to grasp (or clean around). First few dishes slightly underdone. good safety feature that it switches off if anything is covering the hob area that should not be. Very quiet and oven and heats up quickly. Slightly difficult to wire in as has two different security screws on the mains power cover.",Approved
Really pleased with the new cooker ;it’s really fast and very nice to look at but best of all the meals that I cook are even tastier .,Approved
This handheld hoover is great! By far the most powerful and user friendly I’ve owned. I would not have picked it had the shop not had it assembled as a demo model. So that might be something you can look at.,Approved
"This is my second AEG tumble dryer appliance (AEG Tumble Dryer T6DBG822N) and I am very pleased. I have children so utilise the machine very frequently. This model looks very smart but most importantly it is very easy to use, it is quiet for a tumble dryer and dries clothes faster than the older model I had. There are a number of functions available, such as level of dryness in a selected program, so gives the user much more flexibility and variety. I would highly recommend this machine.",Approved
Great machine and works a treat but does put a lot of heat into the room when running.,Approved
Purchased to replace a 20 year old Bosch tumble dryer...very impressed with AEG quality and ease of use.,Approved
"After having bosch for years, I decided after a recommendation from a friend to get AEG. It's quiet and quick, love the dial and options on each programme",Approved

Good Vale for money and good size drum brilliant best I have had best tumble dryer,Approved
"As well as looking lovely, the product is very intuitive to use, and quiet when it is operating. The programmes are easy to select and the display is well laid out with all the relevant information on show.",Approved
"We got this AEG ProSense condenser tumble dryer & what a fantastic dryer, it looks great in the kitchen, easy to use and reduces the need to iron. Since we had our second child I am astounded by how much washing we have! This is therefore posted by someone who has been using this machine daily and is as pleased with it as I was on day one. It is quiet, easy to use, with many programmes to choose from. The digital display tells you how long you have left until it's finished or reminds you to empty the water tank amongst other things. The position and design of the fluff filter makes it very easy to clean and so is the water container. The water container is easy to empty and the water can be used for the iron as it's distilled water or for watering the plants for example. It takes a large load and is very energy efficient. The dryer feature ProSense technology, which uses advanced humidity and temperature sensors to adjust the drying time and energy consumption for every size of load - whether it’s a day’s or a week’s worth of washing. This saves time and energy, while gently protecting the clothes that you love and wear every day. Drying times shorter and efficient and it changes the timings in spite of what it says initially for the cycle. It also adjusts the cycle times as well so saves us having to re-do a whole cycle.
I haven't found anything I don't like about it, it is  a great buy!",Approved
"Our refrigerator meets all the expectations we had buying from a company with the great reputation of AEG. It is spacious, well laid out with shelves, vegetable compartment and door storage. it is easy to keep clean and keeps food at just the right temperature. Could not fault.",Approved

"Can hardly fault this machine my only slight criticism is you too easily over shoot the temperature or other settings you have to go around again. Also the Start button is light on the touch. 
Minor problems brilliant machine!",Approved
"We've had this tumble dryer about 6 weeks now and I have to say it's the best we've had. We've had AEG tumblers in the past but this one beats them all. 

It has loads of functions to suit everything- duvets, sports clothes, mixed washes and quick drying. 

My wife doesn't usually trust the tumble with the her work clothes and expensive sports kit, but with this tumble dryer she gave it a go and loves it. 

We also really like the dryness level option as we can be a little cautious with more delicate/ expensive items. 

Its also a very quiet machine and has a nice appearance.",Approved
Instructions straightforward not overly complicated but does what it says it will,Approved
"I was a apprehensive about the digital display and choices on my new washing machine, which were all new to me. However, I have found it easy to use and easy to find the options I want for my usual washes. It washes well and quietly and we are very pleased with it. I would strongly recommend this machine.",Approved
This product has quite a few Also a number of different temperature buttons for drying.,Approved
Need a washing machester now quality products quite energy saver best buy,Approved
"I love the speed with which this dryer takes care of our clothes! In our hectic household it is quite common to have to dry children's uniforms in the morning to make them ready for school. It was a problem with our previous dryer, with this one it is a breeze. Yes, it is B rating, but also it is much faster and in my opinion it works with clothes better than the previous A++ model. The difference in the energy consumption is actually very small. It is easy to understand, easy to programm, easy to clean. It has many features and programmes so that is easy to choose the right programm for specific fabrics and items such as the bedding. Clothes come out smelling wonderful and so so soft, it really makes a difference especially to our autistic son. And the speed of drying is just such a plus point, I cannot stress that enough. Jus a fantastic dryer I can reallly reccommend.",Approved
"My last AEG washing machine was 20 years old and decided to change it. Big mistake as went for other make. Terrible service and had trouble changing it, nobody would believe what I told them about the machine. Insisted I go back to AEG and wish I had done this in the first place.",Approved
"I have had AEG washer and dryers most of my married live and been very pleased with them
We moved into a new house and it had Washer/Dryer fitted

Now we have acquired an AEG ProSense T6DBG822N Condenser Tumble Dryer which we are very pleased with",Approved
"Still getting used to, but really pleased with it.",Approved
"I've had this tumble dryer for a few months now to replace my previous AEG which I had to retire after many years of use..
 The tumble dryer looks great a modern design , that only improves as you start to use it .....
  Once I had read the user manual and started to use it as designed it really impressed me, especially the jeans function - would not be without it",Approved
This is my first aeg product and I love it very much it’s efficient and quiet,Approved
good looking and performs well.good value for money.,Approved
We bought this machine as we wanted to ensure we had a warranty as the machine would get almost daily use. After 2 years it started to not try as fully as it should and then a belt went after 3 years. Bit worrying....so we'll wait and see. We paid more hoping we'd get a bit more longevity....fingers crossed.,Approved
Very pleased with the layout of this fridge Food very accessible to take out considering it is an under counter fridge.,Approved
"We have two children so the amount of laundry we do is CRAZY...the dryer does the job fast and clean.
The door is very big so you can push your clothes easily.
PERFECT product PERFECT price!",Approved
"This is a spacious fridge, good salad drawers, lots of space and shelves etc. 
Has been reliable and works well",Approved
In 4th year under 5 year guarantee needed control panel now needs another!!!,Approved
Seems Ok so far. Quality is good but would not describe it as outstanding. Inside light would be more illuminating if it was located at the front as at the back can get shielded by fridge contents. The capacity is about 10% less than the fridge it replaced but seems on a par with others on the current market Overall satisfied,Approved
"Sleek design

This integrated fridge is sleek in design and well thought out. Shelving can be moved around to accommodate different heights of food stuff . One of the shelves can be halved. Door capacity is excellent holding many bottles 
The biggest drawback is the depth of the fridge, 14” pizza needs to be carefully positioned within the fridge else the door will hit against it when closing",Approved
"This was the largest ‘standard size’ integrated fridge I could find. Very quiet operation and good cooling capability. Huge slide out draw at bottom for drinks but really missing a good slide out veg/salad drawer above it. Door storage good, but need to be careful that items stored on the shelves don’t stop the door shutting.",Approved
"Very good fridge, easy to see the contents. No way of seeing the actual temperature, only the target temperature.

There were screws missing on the bottom rail which comes off occasionally so not good build quality or quality assurance.",Approved
"I have lots product but only one it’s best AEG
Now only buying products from AEG",Approved
"I have had this machine a few weeks now and am very pleased with it, it has loads of features and options probably more than I will use. I especially like the fact it weighs what’s in the drum and adjusts the washing time accordingly other machines have a set washing time depending on the programme selected. I like that I can adjust the temperature and the spin speed. Overall an excellent machine.",Approved
Offers everything I could possible need in a refrigerator,Approved
Apart from the integrated butter shelf in the door which is not deep enough for easy access this fridge is brilliant. We eat mainly fruit and veg and the storage options means our food stays fresher for longer saving us loads of money as we are throwing away less than we used to.,Approved
"The T7DBE831R tumble dryer runs quietly and despite being located in a small room produces little heat. The Delay is a great bonus and the heat cycle durations are accurate-i.e. as programmed.
The Activewear (sportswear) option is very effective. Bed-linen is no longer creased-just take it out and fold it. The large capacity water tank is nonetheless easy to take out.
The fluff collector has a triple filter – nothing gets past it! The only shortcoming found was often small items (children’s socks) would be found in the door-surround at cycle-end and not dry.
Overall; a very efficient tumble dryer with excellent facilities – and with a genuinely large drum.",Approved
"Quiet, reliable and easy to use. Best machine I've ever owned by far. My favourite thing about it is the way the drum turns during washing - it speeds up then slows down in such a way as to ensure clothes don't end up in a dead zone for the entire wash. Very clever - and shows the thought gone in to creating this machine.",Approved
Great fridge / freezer easy to adjust settings and plenty of door / shelf room,Approved
"I had chosen the aeg model I wanted from the reviews,but when we got to John Lewis they no longer sold it. We bought this much more expensive model. It dries most things fairly well ,but over quite a long time and often needs to be given an extra' timed' period. But when I put in bed linen it seems to take the edges tougher and winds the sheets into such a tight knot it is difficult to undo. This leaves the sheet in hundreds of creases.  I need to open the door regularly and shake the sheet to stop this happening. 
It is quite noisey.",Rejected
"Firstly the instructions are simple to use, a great machine with a comprehensive range of programmes and options. I have dried delicate clothes and would highly recommend this machine. The child lock is a great feature.",Approved

"We had the previous version/generation, which never really dried well and required endless defluffing from the fins. Was a bit cautious about buying the AEG again but are very happy with it, especially the lack of maintenance.",Approved
Replaced free standing model with this one as had new kitchen. Not as much space as integrated. Shelf height quite low so can only put taller bottles etc on top shelf. Keeps temperature correct and very quiet in operation. Good economy rating. Although has slight disadvantages I am pleased with my purchase.,Approved
"Took a bit of time getting used to the great technology. We were used to lots of direct heat just blasting our clothes. This one does not necessarily do that, it senses what is required! Amazing product would not be without it. This product can actually steam items such as our children's furry animals. How cool is that for cleanliness !",Approved
"I am thrilled to bits with my new washing machine very easy to use and does a fantastic job, all my washing clean and creases are dramatically reduced 
thank you AEG",Approved
"Purchased this AEG as previous AEG machine lasted 12 years with low maintenance. Like the load for cottons at 9 kg, other programmes are for less.than 9kg. Like the time saver and extra rinse. Have tried the steam programme but didn’t notice a significant difference in making clothes easier to iron. There two features which could be improved, firstly reduce noise of spinning cycle and make the selection buttons more responsive. Overall, satisfied with purchase.",Approved

It has a massive sized door so it is easy to get laundry in and out.  But be careful as many programmes recommend using much less weight of laundry than that which can be crammed in!

The door does not have a release button but does need a firm tug to open it - this could be advised in a future edition of the manual

The water container and filters are easy to get at, empty and clean.

Every new product takes some getting used to and so we always read all instructions,  For this we like all supplied instructions and manuals to be clear and accurate.  And in this case it is about 90% good straight off.  

The only niggles are :
Under Drying Hints on the instructions for setting the water hardness level which really should refer to section 9.2 of the manual.
The Drain the Water indicator on our machine seems  to stay on all the time even when the water container is empty.
The Wool Wash seems to have a delay before starting and is more of a stop and go process than we were previously used to.

Other than those few niggles, we found everything else to work as per the manual and the instructions to be pretty self evident.

The anti-crease function works better than any other we have tried and quite often no ironing is really needed.

It will dry single and double duvets, but seemingly not king or superking which will have to be dried elsewhere due to their size / weight

The drier program will automatically sense dryness to end earlier than probably expected once the selected dryness level is reached - this saves time and money. And cares for the clothes better too.

There is less moist air in the room using this drier than a previous condensor drier and so this machine's condensor function seems very efficient.

Tumble driers always use a fair bit of electricity, However this model seems to use less than most condensor driers yet leaves the washing as dry as chosen and in less need of ironing but looking good!

Overall we are very pleased with this drier and hope to keep it for a good long time",Approved
"Tumble dries the clothes beautifully even set to auto. Great efficiency cost wise to run. Also the water I use for ironing which is an added bonus.
The only problem which exists with most driers is the duvet king size does at times get knotted up slightly. Fantastic product  to use.",Approved

I love this hand held vacuum cleaner. It’s ideal for vacuuming my stairs. I haven’t used it in the car yet but I know it will be so much easier than using my big vacuum cleaner. It’s not heavy and easy to empty and the lead is very long. I really wish I had got one when we first moved into our present home as the stairs are so steep and have a turn. I’ve really struggled using my big vacuum cleaner. Like that the tool is held within the vacuum so it’s always to hand.,Approved

We have been very surprised at the length of cycle times which could be better explained at time of purchase or in the instruction manual. We purchased the machine to solve a particular space problem and since there only 2 of us the 'washing' demand is easily handled however the length of cycle times was very much a surprise.,Approved
"This AEG washer dryer is a fantastic product. It is very quiet and, even at the 1600 rpm spin speed, it is incredibly stable. It washes well, even at lower temperatures, and the “hand wash” programme is great for delicate fabrics. The dryer programmes take some time to achieve the best results but, after the initial familiarisation period, the results are great. All in all, this appliance is an excellent performer and is available an a great price.",Approved

The display and controls are practical & very user-friendly. Each option/cycle does exactly what it says.
Drying times are accurate. Towels and bed-linen are always dry - no more reloading!
I no longer have to worry about clothes left in the machine, they won't be creased.
The triple filter is sturdy, easy to clean and very effective-fluff doesn't get past it. The condenser drawer is easy to empty.
Small items such as a sock can still get caught in the door well.
Overall a fast and accurate yet quiet dryer.",Approved
"Having had an ""American style fridge freezer"" in the past, I would not have one again as the freezer unit is so narrow and small, it is totally impractical.

Just waiting to get the kitchen re-vamped, so we can have it alongside the larder fridge!",Approved
"Excellent value for money. A real strong cleaner, and all tools on board. I can’t recommend this enough.",Approved
"Expected a lot more from this over priced machine. Firstly the depth is more than standard machines so it juts out from the space in my fitted kitchen. It meant I couldn't open a cupboard door so that had to be taken off.
The pause button is so incredibly sensitive that it activates if just brushed against - easily done as it juts out. You might think it goes back if pressed again but oh no, it has to be switched off and restarted as it goes back to a combined wash and dry program which wasn't set in the first place.
Setting the timer for the dryer is a nightmare too. It goes up in 5 minute slots and the button has to be pressed sometimes several times to go to the next slot.
I don't like the handle on the door set where it is, it is very awkward.
Cleans ok but no better than any other machine and my whites are not as white.
Quite honestly I wish I'd never bought it but I'm stuck with it now.",Approved
Over all a nice easy to use powerful little cleaner. Unfortunately ours broke less than a year after purchase and AEG have still not got back to me about repairs or a replacement as it's still under Warren ty.,Approved

"We have used the tumble dryer since the end of August, so we are only just really beginning to make the most if it. The machine is easy to use but the touch screen is very sensitive so you need to get used to this as sometimes you can scroll up and down the programs several times while trying to reach your chosen setting.
We were asked to trial this machine and overall found it to be excellent.  Its big plus points are the efficient way it dries towels and bedding.
The tank is easy to empty and filter easy to clean.  Obviously to maintain the machine correctly both of these operations should be done after each use, and there is an illuminated reminder at the end of each cycle.
The machine is quiet in operation - I'm not entirely sure what use the quiet mode is, I found little difference in noise level, just that the program was longer.
The only negative comment I would make is when underwear and socks were on the drying cycle, a sock found its way into the hinge side of the door and remained there for the duration of the cycle, coming out tightly bunched and damp.  I noticed this each time I dried underwear and socks.
I would advise using the anti-crease program when drying shorts; I prefer to avoid ironing if possible and without this selected, shirts definitely require an iron.
All in all I found the machine to be excellent, the operation easy, the ""window"" door useful and the anti-crease helpful.
The four temperature settings are also useful - if you prefer to iron clothes then the iron dry setting would be good, however, using this setting would leave you having to 'hang' washing for it to air dry, making the tumble drying process, to a certain degree, pointless - I prefer to tumble dry and put away!",Approved
"The kettle has great features and fits in perfectly with my kitchen. Unfortunately after a week it was detecting water straight out of the tap as being 95°C, meaning it then would refuse to heat it. My replacement is working better but I'm concerned it's going to breakdown again.",Approved

"After using the 8000 series tumble dryer for the last few weeks I can say only one thing it is BRILLIANT I have dried everything in it including my husbands woollen jumper and I couldn't believe it when it came out ready to wear, no shrinkage, so I tried one of my silk blouses in it and the result was the same, it also helps with the ironing with a reduced crease feature  which for a full time working mum that is a big plus too. The controls are so easy to use and it is so quiet that I had to check I had turned it on. I have also used it to dry my king size duvet as the drum capacity is so big the result was very impressive I can highly recommend the machine, it is first class. Well done AEG",Approved

"This AEG dryer is without a shadow of doubt one of the best dryers ever made, from its sleek design to its high performance. 

Its design gives it an almost futuristic appearance, with its clean white body, alongside the chrome interface and accents. It will light up any kitchen/utility room. I have had a lot of compliments on mine. 

It has good build quality. It is nice and sturdy, backed-up by AEG 5 years guarantee.I like where the handle is placed. With our old dryer, the door handle was placed to the right hand side of it and was easily opened by our toddlers, resulting in us putting a child lock on it. This one however has the door handle towards the top right and with more pressure, resulting in it being harder to be open by my toddlers. Therefore eliminating the need for child locks. It has a great capacity of 9kg, which is excellent for medium to large size families. 

It has ten programmes. Anything you put in your washing machine, you can dry. You can dry your wool and silk. I put my wool jumpers in and they did not have any shrinkage or bobbling on them. I would have never dreamt of putting my jumpers in my old dryer. When I put my bed sheets in, they came out all dry and not tangled. They were dry evenly, right from the middle to the end, another thing I could not do in my old dryer. I could peacefully put any garment in this dryer and know it will be safe. I just pick a programme and let the sensors do the work for me. 

It is super energy efficient. I have a smart reader in my house. When I used my old dryer the colour indicator would go towards amber but with this it stayed firmly on green, proving its efficiency. My wife and I could not believe it. We are a family of six, with two toddlers. Our washing machine is on everyday and now our dryer will be too.",Rejected

"This product is great,it has great further,would definitely recommend",Approved
"I replaced my older, AEG condenser dryer with this one just under a month ago. After unpacking & moving it into it’s new home, the first thing that struck me was the significant aesthetic improvement. The clear door portal and improved control panel make a huge difference over my previous dryer which was all white, and looked a little dated!

Another thing worth mentioning before I get onto performance, is ease of use. The list of selectable programmes is clear and meaningful, and the digital display offers up reassuring information about acceptable load weight, estimated drying time, and any other programme tweaks that you may have selected (anti-crease time, low noise mode etc). Emptying the water from the front loading tank, and cleaning any fluff from the filters is also extremely easy, taking less than a minute.

Performance wise, I could not ask for more. This machine offers consistent, impressive results, with no nasty surprises. It provides these results whilst looking after my clothes a little better than my older dryer. I suppose the best way to describe this is that my clothes seem to come out of this dryer feeling softer than when I used to take them out of my old dryer.

The final thing to mention is the noise… It is so much quieter than my old dryer.

In short this is a proper, well built, modern appliance that performs as good as it looks. I would definitely recommend spending a little more on your tumble dryer to get a quality unit like this one.",Approved

"I have had the AEG T8DSC849R heat pump tumble dryer for a couple of months now and given it a pretty good workout drying all the families washing.

First impressions – It looks good – the brushed steel of the front panel nicely matching in with the rest of the kitchen.  Installation is easy because it does doesn't need ducting out and in operation it’s very quiet so even drying clothes late in the evening for the next day isn’t a problem.

Next thing to like is the size of the door.  It’s huge. And behind it is a drum that’s just as big – it’s virtually the whole width of the machine so it easily swallows big items like one of the kids single bed duvet and would probably dry a double bed duvet without to much problem as well.

Use wise, it’s simple to select one of the programs on the large dial, make any adjustments with the touch panel such as level of dryness and press start.  All of the programs display an approximate time that they will take to complete, and as the cycle runs the machine monitors various sensors to optimise drying and keep the cycle as short as possible.

So - How well it dries.  AEG in it’s marketing makes a great deal of it’s Absolute Care technology for washing and drying.  They have gained Woolmark accreditation meaning that hand wash woollen items can be machined washed and dried in it’s machines.  My daughter has a hand wash woollen throw on her bed that she absolutely loves and till now has forbidden me to wash because she didn't want it to stretch or go ‘weird’.  I’m happy to report that after washing it in my new AEG washing machine on the wool program, the dryer did a great job – spinning the drum faster than the usual programs so that the contents stayed ‘stuck’ to the side of the drum and didn’t tumble around which is what causes the fibres to get matted.  It has no stretching either and it still folds square.  So now it smells better and she still loves to snuggle under the throw.

Another way to tell that the dryer is being as gentle as possible with the washing is that the filter doesn't seem as full of fluff from the clothes at the end of the cycle as with my old non AEG driers.

The standard level of dryness is what AEG calls cupboard dry which takes a little getting used to – as the washing comes out nice and warm but a little damp.  I've found that if it’s taken out and folded within a short while of the cycle finishing the dampness quickly evaporates and the clothes don’t need ironing (leastways in my house anyway!)

I have used about half of the programs so far including wool and duvet, but it’s the synthetic or mixed programs which take about an hour that get the most use.  Everything comes out nice, fresh and easy to fold.

Finally – Running costs.  The machine has an energy rating of A++ which is impressive for a tumble dryer.  It’s mainly down to the heat pump technology which recycles as much energy as possible.  Well with no other changes since getting the AEG tumble dryer at the end of June and the AEG washing machine mid August our average electricity usage has gone down according to the Smart Meter.  It also comes with a full 5 year parts and labour warranty so it fixes my costs for the next 5 years.

To recap - As a single working dad to 3 girls of school age, I wanted a machine that was simple to use, quick and quiet so I can run it in the evening if I have to, economical and have a good warranty.  This AEG machine more than fits my criteria which is why I give it top marks.",Approved
"Our tumble dryer remained faultless for two years but then it stopped drying due to the heater not working. When we bought it we paid top price due to it's efficiency credentials. We expected a longer life than two years. 
Nevertheless, it served us well in that time, often being used on a daily basis.",Approved
Led display is unreadable just a big red blur. Only just over a year old,Approved
"I have used this drier on various settings, all with very good results. The machine is quiet and the dried clothes have very little creasing.I was hesitant about using the wool programme, not quite believing my woollens wouldn't shrink. I found 3 sweaters I hadn’t worn for some time and didn't mind experimenting with. One was 100% cashmere and the others 100% merino wool and lambswool. To my astonishment none of them shrank and in fact were in better shape than if I had flat dried them! So much better than soggy sweaters taking ages to dry in winter. I can’t fault this machine and I’m really pleased I chose it.",Approved
"It's true it looks great, and is well built, but after two months of ownership I've still had little success when it comes to dry clothes. they are never dry unless I run the machine on the manual timer. the 'prosense' function never delivers a satisfactory result. Very disappointing given how expensive it was to buy.",Approved
I love this tumble dryer. Has to be the best tumble dryer I have ever bought in my life. So easy to take out water and clean filter,Approved
"it is simply not drying. it is very expensive but doing almost nothing. do not buy this product. it is not drying , it is not condensing water. service has visited. changed the electronics. from the first run after repair it is still the same. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT IS FAULTY PRODUCT.",Approved
"This tumble dryer is really easy to use. You just select the programme and go. It's default mode is 'eco' meaning it can take a little longer than other machines but very economical, I'm no longer afraid of using the tumble dryer! Also I don't need to use any unsightly drying racks anymore as you can dry delicates, woollens and silks in the machine, game changing! And it's quiet too!!",Approved
"Really nice, solid and quality tumble dryer, it's quiet and I seem to get away with tumble drying clothing that I wouldn't normally! So definitely recommend it. No complaints!",Approved
"Excellent tumble dryer with all the settings you would expect for bed linen, sports clothing etc. It is very quiet to use and has an extra quiet mode if needed. The dryer senses when the clothes are dry which saves energy and protects your clothes by only running for as long as necessary. The instructions are very simple and the machine is easy to use. The filter is very easy to clean and emptying the water tank could not be simpler. We use the delay start function a lot which is very useful. All in all this dryer has everything you could possibly want and does a great job.",Approved
"This machine has thoroughly impressed me.
The only possible negative is that it doesn't have an option to add extra water.. however it just doesn't seem to need it. My whites are WHITE. The cycles are quite longish but very quiet and really large capacity. HAPPY!!",Approved
The air conditioner is good and works well but was unfortunately supplied with a short vent hose which did not reach any of our windows. Support helpline email was not replied to.,Approved
"A superb portable air conditioner and looks very smart wherever you put it. We were really surprised how quickly it cooled the room and were actually quite shocked how hot other rooms that we weren't using it in now felt. Very effective, looks good and decent value. Highly recommended.",Approved
"Can't complete installation because of lack of information on how to install stainless steel duct cover boxing.  Product is useless as it cannot be fitted. Have wasted my money will now have to consider an alternative.  Also can not find details on this web-site even though I can see every detail about the extractor, there is nothing about the duct.",Approved
"The oven has great features like quick heat, the Steam bake, and a meat thermometer. It cooks great, looks great, everything about it is great",Approved
"I was a bit nervous about buying the induction hob as I had used gas all my life, im glad that i did so easy to use and looks lovely.",Approved
"Very good Hob, Looks great and very easy to keep clean.
Boils water quicker that anything I've used before.",Approved
Nice design. Looking good and works perfect. Easy to clean.,Approved
"This is controllable it is in my opinion as near as u would get to a gas cooker, also the rapid heat setting on on stove top boils water in a saucepan in a few minutes. I absolutely love this oven wish I had bought one years ago.",Approved
Very effective at vacuuming stairs and furniture and with two large dogs is used almost daily. Good price. The down side is it is heavy and this is maybe where further research and development would score more positive points. I found that I can start the stairs fine but by the end of the job my wrist knows I've been working,Approved
Easy to use. Oven and top oven heat up quickly and cook evenly. Hob controls very responsive.,Approved
Found this handheld hoover excellent for the car and the stairs would highly recommend it,Approved
"When unpacked I thought to myself this looks like a beast. I was not disappointed, it attacked my stair carpet as though there was no tomorrow and the amount of debris it extracted from what I thought were reasonably clean stairs really surprised me.",Approved
Well made oven. Even cooking. Cool front even when up to temperature. Plenty of functionality to suit all types of cooking.,Approved
"Being a mother of two young children, laundry features heavily in my daily routine so I was very excited when offered this washing machine FOC by AEG in exchange for my honest opinion of the product. Having previously owned several high-end branded washing machines I consider myself to be a knowledgeable, demanding and critical consumer, but this machine has completely exceeded my expectations. The 9 Kg load capacity is perfect for washing all my family’s towels, or all the bedding from our 6ft bed in one wash, so I now do fewer washes. It is incredibly energy efficient, weighing the load in the drum and adjusting the wash cycle so as not to over-wash, even if only a small load is inserted. It advises me as to the amount of detergent needed to achieve a perfect result every time. Water and detergent are premixed before being sprayed in to the drum leading to perfect cleaning results while minimizing the use of detergent and water, and a fourth compartment for stain removing agents ensures that the stain remover is added at the optimum time to achieve the best cleaning result. It is the first washing machine I have used where I can say that I am confident that the clothes will be perfectly clean even on a 30-degree wash. The machine’s sleek modern design is attractive. It offers a multitude of very useful programs. I love the Woolmark approved program for hand-wash only sweaters and the steam program for freshening up a suit or dry-clean only dress. The machine is easy to use and allows you to customize your programs with the press of a button to change the temperature of the wash or its duration. By far it is the best washing machine I have used.",Approved
"Great machine. Quiet, with a good range of features. The time save setting is great.",Approved
The freezer is fine and appears to be very good quality. Only down side is severely strong magnetic door seal which is so strong that the appliance moves significantly when opening the door. I have seen the same comment in other reviews. Hoping it loosens with use.,Approved
"Great hob, once you get used to it! Love it, fantastic, really quick.",Approved
"We have been using our AEG washing machine now for several weeks and I must say how please we are with it, as expected with AEG the build quality was evident as soon as it was unwrapped, it looks very modern and stylish and easy to use. We wanted something that was quiet had good build quality had all the programs that we required for an ordinary household and that was easy to use and also was not going to break the bank, had a good guarantee, and this lovely machine fitted the requirements, with room to spare, and with a five year guarantee and as we already had an AEG oven we knew it was a brand to be trusted.
So we are very please with our decision and we would thoroughly recommend this machine.",Approved
"Can’t quite work out how to remove door for cleaning. Shelves not as rigid as those in past ovens I’ve had. But overall, this is a super oven that I shall enjoy using.",Approved
"The design is sleek, but simple. And works in the kitchen perfectly.

The oven itself heats up nice and quickly, and has enough features to satisfy an aspirational chef :)

All in all a good product.",Approved
Great features. Various oven settings for different types of food. Oven heats up very quickly to required temperature. Varied shelf positions. A bgreat product.,Approved
The freezer is frost free which is great and the drawers are really big compared to other under counter freezers we reviewed.,Approved
Very pleased with storage capacity of freezer ...lots of room in each of the drawers. Good quality and worth paying a little bit more than for a cheaper brand,Approved
"Needed to replace our existing AEG Washing Machine 88730 Update which had lasted 15 years until a fault appeared and decided to buy another AEG. What a difference this L8FEC866R is compared to the last. The machine is just as quiet but much more efficient at washing with a bigger drum and load capability. The display is large and informative with so many more features and washing options. We tend to run the OKOPower programme quite a lot and can change temperature, spin speed, add extra rinses easily. With 3 extra rinses, the programme runs for about 1 hour 25 minutes which is excellent. The machine spins up to 1600 rpm and is very quiet. Clothes come out very clean. We do miss the internal drum light, though, which we had on the last machine. AEG have put this feature in all their high end kitchen machines to date. Hope they will bring it back. We can highly recommend this machine.",Approved
"Recently purchased one of these... love the oven. Instruction book was a bit vague, but oven great... heats up quickly... super.",Approved
This is a replacement for another unit which failed within 14 months. It is stylish and works quietly . Very pleased with it . The installation engineer was polite and efficient also.,Approved
Just what we required 100% Every thing so neatly built in.,Approved
"We have a fully fitted AEG dishwasher. It has performed well until now.We had the engineer visit under warranty to examine a hairline crack in the fascia near the on/off switch. He was great, and assured us this would not affect the performance one iota. 2 weeks later, now out of warranty, the WATER HEATER IN THE DISHWASHER HAS BROKEN! This should not happen AEG after 2 years only of use. We're very disappointed!",Approved
Love this dryer. Looks great and is so easy to use with its touch facility,Approved
"Really good oven. Best we've ever had. Would definitely recommend to friends and family,",Approved
Chose this model because we needed a 50/50 split. It set the correct temperatures very efficiently and has been trouble free. We like the led light's position central top of ceiling - good clear light. Seems easy to keep clean. Only weak feature the size of the egg tray - we like XL eggs - doesn't cope very well. Plus is unit's quietness.,Approved
We buy more fresh food than frozen so the 70:30 combination is ideal for us. Nice and bright inside fridge everything is easy to see. Clear drawers makes it easier. Would highly recommend. Love that the freezer is frost free and has clear drawers too.,Approved
"Made s good choice, an excellent oven. A pleasure to use and cook with",Approved
Fitted with a new kitchen. Neither fridge nor freezer worked (temp in fridge 20 degrees). Engineer arranged by installer and replacement arranged through local agent. Completed quickly and all fine now.,Approved
"excellent buy plenty of room in both fridge and freezer ,very good range of settings ,good quality draws ,Easy to fit .good size for a family of four adults.",Approved
Not impressed we did a lot of resource and thought this was a good quality low noise appliance. This is not the case and I would not recommend it.,Approved
A versatile oven in that you can use the fan to cook or just the top and bottome element. That is good for baking certain items . I also like the guide which shows how the oven is reaching the desired temperature and the audible ping when it is fully heated. I have not had to use the self clean yet. all in all I am delighted with this oven and would recommend it.,Approved
"This oven is fantastic, easy to use and cooks food perfectly every time , great features and very easy to keep clean , very happy with my purchase",Approved
"Bought as my old machine (not AEG) was starting to age badly. I've never owned an AEG appliance so did loads of research. The machine does everything I need and more, is simple to use with very clear instructions. It takes a little getting used to the touch controls as they are very sensitive but I've got the hang of that now. I haven't found one issue with the machine in my first month of using it...hopefully it'll stay that way",Approved
"The machine itself is very quiet, even on the full spin, and usually its only the clothes splashing around in the machine that makes the noise; the drive itself is so quiet! 

I've been delighted with it so far, our clothes come out with much fewer creases than they did on my old machine.

Drum is huge and I can fir lots of clothes in it, yet still very few wrinkles when I take them out. Makes ironing so much easier.",Rejected
Recently purchased an AEG Okomix 8000- 1600 spin speed and i have to say it is ultra quiet in its operation. I have used mainly the cotton program at a reduced time and also the 20 minute wash function. I also washed a down- filled jacket that was extremely dirty- it came out looking new. I am very impressed with the quality of the machine and the way it looks in our utility room. I spent a considerable amount of time online to find the right washing machine at the right price and this has exceeded my expectations.,Approved

Little bit deeper than previous machines I’ve had, but that’s not really an issue.

The dryer function hasn’t shrunk anything. So I’m happy!",Approved
The large drum means I'm not doing laundry every other day. It's much quieter than my old machine too.,Approved

This is the first time I have had an AEG oven. It’s looks great and also has great functions. It does seem to cook slightly more on one side. Not sure why. Maybe it’s not level in the cabinet. This is why I gave 4 stars rather than 5. However I love it and the pyrolytic is amazing. Would definitely recommend.,Approved
Very quick to warm up and quiet too. Haven't had time to try all the functions yet but we are really looking forward to trying some baking,Approved
Great looking and very quiet. On the large side so check the dimensions beforehand!,Approved
Best washer and dryer ever! I can wash and dry so many clothes in a short period of time. Always comes out dry. It can however get very noisy especially when drying. I find I have to switch it on when I go to bed because the pattern of noises it needs to go through are very distracting and too loud. My other comment is that the touch features don’t always register your touch and I find myself needing to overly exaggerate my touch for it to register.,Approved
"man, it is ever. why do i have to write a review this long?",Approved
Even browning and lots of features. Self clean function is very good as well.,Approved

"Bought this cooker after extensive researching into induction cookers, and my partner and I are thoroughly pleased with our purchase. Its well-designed, easy to clean and the hob is excellent once you get used to the controls. The power function is great, and brings pans up to temperature very quickly. The oven is fantastic also - no hot spots, makes great roasties etc. though do spend some time reading the manual and learning what the different settings do. The one small design flaw with this oven is that the legs are a bit too short, so the hob is a bit lower than our kitchen worktop. This seems to be a common complaint of this cooker, but one that can be easily remedied by putting a piece of wood underneath the I'm sure. To be honest, it hasn't bothered us that much. So in summary, and excellent cooker and well worth the money in my opinion.",Approved

Loving this oven - it is so straight forward to use. The push dial is great and is fantastic to navigate around the menus. The number of features is amazing and together with the food probe make cooking a breeze. I have cooked several roast chickens now and they come out perfect. I have dried granola and that has come out excellent. The slow cooker options was perfect for a lamb stew. Owned a very fancy range before with three ovens - this AEG beats it hands down.

"This machine was bought to replace my previous washing machine which had performed exceptionally for 16 years, so it had a lot to live up to. Initial reactions were that it was well designed and good looking, and it appeared well specified and had some interesting features. Having used the machine for one month,I am very satisfied with its performance in every respect. It is easy to operate and very quiet throughout the cycle. I was surprised at the length of time some programmes take, but I gather that this is the norm with modern machines - and anyway, there are various time saving options if required. There is a wide range of programmes, which seem to cover most eventualities and living in a hard water area, the Softwater Technology should prove very useful. On the evidence of its performance during my relatively short term of ownership, I would happily recommend this machine.",Approved

"Firstly I have not owned an AEG product before, What can I say the steam oven is absolutely fantastic I baked my first loaf of bread yesterday. One of the features is a steam prover it worked a treat only 15 minutes and the bread was ready to bake, one of my first jobs was working in a bakery the proving function works exactly the same as it did in the bakery awesome, then all I had to do was select bake bread and what type of bread I was baking on the oven menu which was a yeasted plait. I have to say it's the best bread I have baked at home period, the rest of my family said it tasted exactly the same as the ones we buy. Also oven ready chips normally come out a bit dry and hard not so in this oven I selected a program from the menu and the results were brilliant I'm looking forward to using the rest of the features on this oven. I can't wait to try the heat probe on some beef for a Sunday roast. Thanks AEG",Approved
"Great product and design but it had been damaged at factory, which should have been spotted - packing was not damaged but unit had obviously been dropped causing a buckled corner - this was cosmetic and didn't affect operation - but not what I expected from AEG",Approved
"This machine is great. It replaced and extremely noisy machine and the door never shut properly so this is a fantastic addition to my kitchen because It is extremely quiet, washes clothing and sheets really well. I really like that you can add salt in the drawer so you can soften the water and the feature where you can do a steam clean if you’ve only worn something briefly to freshen is wonderful. I would definitely recommended this machine",Approved
"It’s so nice to have an oven that does all I can ask of it. So far every thing I’ve tried is great, the features are good and the results are excellent. Warm up time is short so I’m not waiting to cook. I Highly recommend this great looking oven that’s a joy to use.",Approved

"I am proud to say that I am a very happy owner of the AEG 8000 Series eat pump dryer with Smart technology. The look, styling and capability of this dryer is second to none. It also sits next to and compliments my new AEG Washing machine which also has smart tech. The drying apacity is huge not only in relation to the amount of clothes the drum can hold but also the many drying options that are available to you (the refresh option is most useful). The fact that a light comes on inside the drum when you open the door is also a great feature (no more lost socks). Another useful feature the designers have incorporated is the ease in which you can empty the water. The fully compact container is positioned above the drum so there is no need to bend down !! Regarding the app this too is extremely user friendly and what I really love is the way that you are told how long the drying cycle you have selected will take and the actual time it will finish - genius. My laundry has never felt so soft - no more hard towels or scratchy jumpers. The dryer operates so quietly too. As with my washing machine, this is another quality product and worth paying extra for. How times have changed. I never thought I'd be carrying out the washing and drying chores via an app on my phone whilst sitting my lounge but I can honestly say that 'doing the laundry is no longer a chore and the finished result are great.",Rejected

"I can honestly say this is my favourite household appliance! It has made my life so much easier!
I've always been wary about getting a tumble dryer as you always hear stories of clothes getting shrunk etc. however, this is an absolute dream! The amount of settings and variables available to ensure your clothes are taken care of is amazing. I've always struggled to get my washing dry, but with this dryer ANYTHING and can go in and it will always comes out super soft, dry and ready for the cupboard. The trick, I find with this though, is when you stick your hand in the drum the clothes still feel slightly damp - don't be fooled! All you have to do is shake the item of clothing and it turns dry, like magic! 
I could not live without this product now we've got it!",Approved
What can I say we have recently upgraded to the heat pump tumble dryer and what a difference it has made to our lives. Our old product was no longer able to dry our clothes and so living in the UK you struggle to dry your clothes throughout numerous times of the year due to the weather and we were forced to use some of the radiators which is not only is an eyesore but never gets the clothes dry and would sometimes leave a bad odour.  Now with the new tumble dryer all of the issues have gone. It was easy to connect literally just plug it in and search for WiFi and away you go. The WiFi and AEG app is a nice feature allowing you to select and start a program and we have found the most useful part is being able to check the amount of time left from your phone which saves you the hassle of constantly checking when it’s done!  The clothes are dry and smell fresh and have a great bounce to them. I would recommend this product.,Approved
"So far, I am very pleased with the cooker. Surprised there is only one temperature for the grill, I used to heat my plates, or keep items warm on a low grill setting. I haven't baked yet but hoping it will have an even temperature. Much quicker heating the hob, therefore more efficient.",Approved

As for the oven. I absolutely love it. I’ve never had such good results when baking and the different settings available are all usable. In particular the pie and pizza setting for a crispy bottom and browner top is very good.

"I bought this AEG when my previous cooker, NOT an AEG, gave up after only 5 years. I was quite nervous spending so much on a cooker but, so far, I’ve not been disappointed.

"This little cordless has changed the way I clean! I have a large house and a messy toddler (and even messier husband) and this is just so easy to grab and quickly zip around. The suction doesn't seem that much but I am always surprised at how much dust is in it at the end of every go. I now vacuum with this at least once a day. It doesn't replace my miele for a more thorough vacuum but is so much more convenient. It's charge is enough for me to quickly go round the large living room, dining room kitchen, hall, stairs and 2 bedrooms. It's lightweight and easy to push. Needs emptying after every use but I don't mind this. Not keen on the handheld part, the nozzle just doesn't seem at the right angle to be much use. I definately recommend this little gem, my house looks much cleaner now!",Approved

"As above which is so irritating and makes this a machine that will not last more than a period of about a half year at 15 frothing operations per week, we drink more and have had three jugs in 12 months as the "" boss"" in the jug lid suffers from thermal fatigue/cracking and the tube then becomes loose and can't be used. Also after one year the machine developed internal steam and water ( condensate) leaks so our machine has been replaced fully after 14 months.

Customer support is disparaging to say the least ; AEG / Electrolux replaced the defective jug assembly twice after a tome of emails, phone calls and endless repeating of the problem; on every occassion AEG/Electrolux told us it was a special concession as they are not obliged t do it; how kind they are ( ?????)

Customer service and attitude is appalling; each time the machine developed the faults Lakeland diverted us to Lavazza who diverted us to AEG who diverted us to Electrolux - I have a new machine now but it will go the same way.

I originally upgraded to the more expensive Fantasia machine because the small Modo Mio machine we originally bought, failed after twelve weeks and then the replacement did too.

I can't say too much positive about Lavazza machines regardles if you buy the small ones or the top of the range one but frankly none of the Lavazza Branded machines are fit for purpose and will fail very quickly if used in a family household where coffee is brewed more than a couple of times a day.

We had a Krupps machine before entering the Levazza debacle, it went for seven years without a hitch and still works perfectly now in the kitchen of my daughter.

All in all I would not recomend either the small Modo Mio or the much more expensive Fantasia which we upgraded too, which I note has dropped in price my more than 30% in 18 months.

I am an Engineer and submitted a proper technical report to AEG/Electrolux on the steam tube failure but got not even a jot of response so let's see, if when they read this very genuine review, any of them ( Lavazza, Lakeland, AEG or Electrolux ) will acknowledge the content or take any positive course of action to correct the very poor design or stop selling these shoddy products.

Please note however, the actual ""spares team"" were very efficient and helpful when it was accepted that I wasn't going to ""go away"" and sent spare parts by next day delivery, albeit as a ""concession""

His oven is exactly what I wanted - cooking for a family of 4 daily I can have both fan ovens on at different temperatures. I can’t belive I took so long buying this oven definitely the way forward for the modern household,Approved
"The first thing that struck me about this machine was that it represents a very significant improvement in quality over our previous AEG tumble drier. It looks very stylish with lots of chrome and reassuringly positive acting dials and buttons. It is also much quieter than our old unit even without using the optional ‘quiet’ setting.

The instruction book is reasonably clear and the controls are quite intuitive, making it relatively easy to operate. The internal light is quite useful.

Clothes come out wonderfully dry and un-creased using the ‘cupboard dry +’ setting. The washing seems very soft with no evidence of any shrinkage. The SensiDry technology appears to work very well by reducing the drying time to suit the characteristics of the actual load.

The excess heat extracted and reused by the heat pump technology means that the utility room stays noticeably cooler during operation than before. I haven’t been able to verify the energy consumption, but based on the manufacturer’s quoted figures, it is over twice as efficient as our previous AEG drier. Based on our usage of around 20 times a week, we could therefore potentially save around £200 to £300 per year in electricity bills over our old machine, which should help to off-set the relatively high initial purchase price.

The audible programme-finished indicator is quite pleasant, and much less irritating than the overly loud one on our previous dryer, meaning that you now know that the drying is finished, but don’t feel the need to have to jump up immediately to switch it off before it drives you insane with its persistent irritating beeping.

The only downside I can see is that we now want to get the matching washing machine.",Approved
"After reading many reviews we choose this hob. Unfortunately once installed if didn't work, so had to get AEG engineer out to rectify fault which was disappointing.

"I went for a 50/50 freezer as we mostly get frozen rather than fresh goods. The space in the freezer is more than enough and is also frost free which means no more fighting with drawers when you want to get the chips out. 
The fridge part is also well spaced. A bottle holder would have been nice which seems to be in most competitor fridges but I can always buy this as an extra and ditch one of the other shelves.

This is very handy and looks great fitted under the microwave and between 2 ovens they match perfectly,Approved
I love the look and features of this appliance so far . I will tell More after cooking my Christmas meal for all the family. The only one thing for me being a smaller lady is that the dials are hard to read the way they are positioned on the dial otherwise very good.,Approved

"Looks great, although I feel the plastic knobs detract slightly from the overall feel of quality. 
Top oven gives me nice crispy coatings on eg fish shop fish and chips, tho pizzas do need turned to ensure an even cook. 
Hob very responsive, tho I did need to buy new pans to use on it. As per a recommendation elsewhere I put a bit of kitchen paper under the pan before using and it has prevented any scratches at all. 
I have not used the main oven yet. 
Expensive but worth the money if, like me, you cook lots.",Approved

After reading some very negative reviews I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of this cooker. There was a very short period of adjustment as with any new cooker. I was used to turning pastry dishes round to get an even cook but I do not have to with this oven. The only thing I would change would be to put the simmer ring at the back but this does not detract from the overall performance.,Approved

As a professional caterer this oven is as good as anything we have in our restaurant,Approved
"A fantastic product! With individual thermostats for the fridge and freezer. The factory settings are perfect for keeping things as they should be, cold fridge and the freezer is nice and cold. There is plenty of adjustment for the shelves in the fridge, which is a must for the array of different sizes of bottles and jars that are on the market.",Approved
After installation I found that the cooling fan was on permanently. This fault was exacerbated by my not being able to make contact with your Service centre.

"I like all the shelves and compartments. It is easy to clean and maintain. As we eat lots of fresh food it is perfect. if you need to store lots of food, especially boxed up ready meal you might need a bigger fridge. I fill mine to the brink on shopping days.

"We purchased the AEG Competence cooker based on the apparently good reputation of the brand and the reviews on the AO.com website. However we have been totally disappointed when the cooker burnt the floor underneath the cooker. Although we have been very patient waiting almost 4 months, many many phone calls and a 'premium?' engineer to investigate the problem, AEG do still do not admit responsibility. During this time I have been frightened that the cooker would set the floor on fire and have not used the main oven. 
We are left feeling as if we are lying. Their responses both from their own company and their engineer service centre has been very negative and almost arrogant.

I shall not be buying AEG again .",Rejected

"Light weight. Powerful suction, but the adjustment for bare floor/long pile/short pile etc has broken within the first 2 months. It's very difficult to empty. The plastic cartridge where the dust and dirt is collected is very hard to twist without spilling it all over yourself. It's then very difficult to get it back in place requiring copious swearing and cups of tea. It's very very noisy. The wonderfully light weight and the robust suction make it a great vacuum however the difficulty in emptying it and the incredibly loud noise it makes means I would not recommend it and we're going to get another trusty Dyson, which while heavier, is quieter and very simple and mess-free to empty.",Approved

"Very disappointed.
The top shelf is too high for 1l box of juice and lowering it gives a very narrow almost unusable shelf
Glass shelves seem to attract condensation compared with wire shelves.
Capacity at bottom is not wide enough for a lettuce crisper.
Door shelves poor design, Top one is molded in and very stylized reducing capacity.
Had to remove one shelf to allow 1l box of juice to fit as well as large milk.
Bottom shelf has just enough room for 4 pint bottle of milk, which catches on next shelf if not careful. Toothed holder has a tendency to lift out.
Egg holder moves around in shelf.

Overall a retrograde design.
Why can't a good design be left alone, or at least designers ask users what they need.",Approved
"This fridge freezer has good qualities,it’s well built,not had it to long so cannot comment on how easy it is to clean or defrosting side of product",Approved

The fridge won't close if too much food is placed on the bottom shelf due to the door bottom tray overhanging. Perhaps a marker line to indicate fill level.",Approved
"After a year of looking for a new cooker I finally decided on this one and I am so happy I did.
Although I would prefer the large front ring to be on the right hand side of the cooker the rings in general are very good. Just trying to get used to the fact that once they are up to temperature they do appear to turn off, the ring stops glowing, but then glows again when they need that extra heat.
Love the size of both ovens. 
I bake 14 Christmas cakes at this time of year and was reluctant has to how they would turn out with a new cooker. No problems, I even managed to bake two at the same time in the main oven, on the same shelf, without any problems. This meant that I cut down on how many days I needed to bake and also cut down on the electricity used. 
I have always used a fan oven but I am looking forward to trying the other features on the main oven, including using the joint probe.
The cooker looks great in my kitchen. I think that any chef would be quite at home with the range of things that the main oven can do.
Instruction booklet clear and easy to understand.
Would definitely recommend and in future I will definitely be buying other AEG products.",Approved
very pleased with our new cooker superb style easy controls spacious oven 's would be perfect if main oven hinge position offered hinges on left,Approved
Great size fridge with plenty of shelves. Unfortunately the half shelf can only be fitted in one or two places so it does limit how we organised the shelves and therefore what we keep on what shelves. Freezer is a bit small and the drawers don’t open fully which is a bit of a pain when getting some things out.,Approved

Heats up very fast so must use less electricity.
Overall very pleased with this cooker.
Timer to quiet though",Approved
"I bought this model because it is the same as my previous fridge-freezer, which lasted over twelve years. However, I am very disappointed - the drawers in the freezer broke apart and holes appeared in the freezer casing about two weeks after the two-year guarantee (from John Lewis) expired. Also, the two salad drawers in the fridge cracked and I have had to use those from the old model, which I had luckily kept.

The old model did not have automatic defrosting, but this new version does not have it either, which is also disappointing, as it is inconvenient to do it manually.

I contacted Customer Services Dept. about these problems but did not receive a helpful response.",Rejected

"The AEG cooker has the build-quality that one might expect from such a manufacturer. It feels solid and robust with the controls being very workmanlike. The capacity of the two ovens is extremely generous; the lower oven would cope with, say, a 20lb turkey with ease. Particularly, the oven feature to be able to cook in different modes is very useful, especially when wishing to bake without fan-assistance. One slightly odd feature is that the upper oven/grill is only able to be used as a grill on its highest setting, making it not possible to grill anything slowly in it; having to use the lower oven/grill if needing a slow grill.
Overall it is an excellent purchase, especially with the 5-year warranty offered. Purchase price is higher than some other cookers, but the extra cost is worthwhile.",Approved
Very expensive provided as part of new build package. The fridge is okay but the freezer is incredibly small. Definitely would not recommend. Fridge very difficult to get at right temperature too,Approved
This product is stylish and has plenty of space for my needs in both fridge and freezer. Good quality build and quiet operation,Approved

Fantastic model with everything included in a compact unit,Approved
Quick to heat up and efficient heat transfer. Confusion of main oven options - what is 'pizza' setting? Not enough choices for shelf placements. Not enough choices of pan sizes. No heat options for grilling in top oven. Food gets trapped beteween controls. Doors become cloudy very quickly.,Approved
Heats up really quickly. Easy to keep clean as the glass panel is easy to remove and clean (once I had worked out how!),Approved
"Love it that ovens use same size shelves. Two of us top oven large enough, family here so easy to use both ovens & be able see what they are each set at. Easy to set ovens in different modes. Also like the fact there is an indicator light showing which plate is on. Kinobs rather than touch controls suit me as I have problems driving touch screens I also like the fact that both ovens have a light, not the case in my previous cooker. The manual appears small but it has a lot of the nformation packed in about the way various modes of cooking can be used. I have yet too try it but it looks as though cleaning the oven doors is going to be much easier for me. A lot of thought has gone into the engineering of this cooker, I would only like to add a couple of suggestions :-
1 I would love to have a cooker which also combined a microwave instead of having to have a separate machine.
2 how about a recipe book to show off its versatility.",Approved
This replaces the equivalent model of 12 years ago which had control readings on the led display. This model sadly has them on the buttons which are not visible for the user standing on the floor. A very obvious weakness in ergonomic design and a retrograde step. I did read this on many reviews before I bought it and perhaps I am stupid to have ignored it. It spoils an otherwise excellent cooker.,Approved
I absolutely love my new cooker and all the features on it. I bought new pans to use with the ceramic hob. The only thing I would say is my job has been marked easily. But would recommend it.,Approved
"Purchased to replace my Belling. The difference between the two is astounding.
This AGE cooker is remarkable in the fact that it knows when your food is cooked perfectly and adjusts the heat accordingly.

"Love the look of this extractor. Installation is difficult and you need someone who will take the time and care to do a really good job. It seems to be effective so far. Only minor difficulty is that when the extractor is in use, it's difficult to see from the front where the button is to lower it once you have finished using it. Because mine is fitted in my island, I can walk round the other side and press the button but if it were against a wall it might be difficult.",Approved
"Cons:
It is very hard to keep clean.
The doors consist of two panes of glass which constantly need cleaning as steam and grease get between the panes. They are a pain to dismantle and badly designed.
The inside surfaces of the oven are very hard to clean. Food splashes seem to burn in straight away and don't come off again, even after using a strong oven cleaner.
Keeping this oven clean is very labour-intensive. I previously had a Creda oven for 25 years and never had any of these problems.
There is no handle for the grill pan and you have to use the grill with the door closed.
The operating instructions are poor.
Pros:
The oven looks great and works really well.
Overall, I am disappointed with this oven, I expected a company like AEG to have a better door design and easy-clean surfaces.
I am almost reluctant to use it.",Approved

Also the fit and make of the guards makes them impossible to clean.",Approved
"I have had BOSCH for 27 years and should not have gone elsewhere especially as the BOSCH was a similar price, but this looked so good. Please do not be drawn in by the pictures. The capacity is not enough for a family of 4 and the plastic parts within the fridge are flimsy and cheap. The Dairy compartment has broken within 2 months of purchase, as the lips on the draw are too short for the wheel mechanism and can not hold any weight that you would expect with cheese and butter. The lip has completely broken off and the drawer is useless. As I only had the fridge freezer 2 months I wrote to AEG and I was told that internal parts are not covered on warranty and I must purchase another drawer myself. Surely this fridge freezer is not fit for purpose!!! 
Do not Buy - you will be as disappointed as I am.",Rejected
"Having bought a new home I have been forced to have Zanussi products in my home. What is really shocking is that all three have seperate issues:

1) The fridge freezer door doesnt close as the magnet around the door is inadequate. I have reported this to Zanussi but have had no reply twice now.

2) the overhead hood had a product call back as it was giving people electric shocks

3) the gas hob has a single plate for placing the pots and pans on it and is designed really dangerously. For instance the fours pots cant sit on the plate at once and if there is any movement at all i.e. taking a pan off the hob they tip over and spill their contents on the floor or anyone who is unlucky to be in the proximity when this happens. In case this is not clear enough Burned child = zanussi hob + hot water

In a nutshell, really poor products throughout their range. Everything is designed with cost reduction inmind. Safety, functionality...not that critical.

I have tried contacting them but they are not responding.",Rejected
"Have recently had a new kitchen fitted and spent a lot of time looking for the right fridge. The kitchen is small but we needed more fridge and less freezer as we have a lot of fresh items, and hence we chose the large capacity of this beautiful fridge....wow we are so happy! Fabulous finish lovely lot of space, well lite and so many shelves with real depth, we would highly recommend this fridge freezer to anyone.",Approved
"Very impressed with the heating up times on the hob, and the generous size of the ovens.",Approved
"Bought this to replace a 20yr Belling. The AEG is a smart looking piece of kit, would enhance any kitchen.
Top 4 rings are various sizes including a duo ring for small or large pot. The hob is easy to clean. Controls are spot on and I don't need my glasses to see numbers. All can wipe clean. The clock has to be set before use, but if you are familiar with touch screen, its easy. Think the oven timing setup could be easier by having 2 different buttons. Also the timer only operates the bottom oven which is daft. However the grill and top oven is brilliant. Adjust the pan height to set the heat strength - no grill variations - its on/off and you close the door. I didn't think I would like the idea but its great and closing the door means really even cooking and very fast with sausage / bacon. Quite a lot of steam comes out of the vent so switch your extractor on. Bottom oven brilliant and the pizza base setting turn out pizza's like the shops, although a bit of a gimmick. The cooker is the best I have owned and cant find any faults after 2 months. Had 5 year warranty as well so all good.",Approved
Great to be back using an electric oven and grill after using a gas oven for the last 12 years,Approved

"good features and frost free capability. Nice alarm feature, well lit and door left opening warning.Space in fridge should be better! Condensation on top of the freezer rubber seal ultimately leads to mould forming.",Approved
"This gas cooker looks really beautiful, the gas burners work fine, the top oven/grill is okay although only having one setting for the grill - on or off - is restrictive. The main oven just does not work properly, at least the model we bought did not work properly. There is a 20 minutes preheat according to the manual, we found this to be true but also you cannot vary the size of the flame during that preheat period after which you can, but by then, well yes a reasonable temperature would be reached, however, it would be too hot for say, letting bread rise. There is no low or ""miser"" setting for doing this, never come across this before with previous cookers. But after the preheat, the cooker takes twice as long as previous cookers to cook. I suspect that the heat is somehow not being circulated. I would never have ordered this cooker if I had known about its poor performance. Definitely to be avoided.",Approved
"Looks fantastic and performs very well as you would expect from AEG. Touch timer settings work well, but just one or two picky minor things, only two grill settings, but when I get used to the shelf positioning this will become less of an issue. The difference between Thermaflow and fan settings is not very well explained, but that could be me stuck in oldie mode. Control knob positioning was a bit confusing to start with but getting used to it now. Giving a 5yr warranty, AEG must be confident in this product. Overall it looks and performs like a quality cooker but time will tell.",Approved
Good quality product easy to use and clean. Looks good to,Approved
"Very nice looking cooker, modern and smart would fit into most kitchens/decor. Haven't been able to use it that much, on day one using the fan caused the house electrics to trip. Engineer couldn't come out for a week and when he did he had to fit a new element for the fan. Second call was to replace the trivet for the grill pan which will take a futher 3 to 4 days to arrive. I can't comment on the features as we haven't used them all which is really dissapointing. This is a new product which you expect to be perfect. Not sure what AEG's quality control is checking, but it obviously wasn't my cooker and having to wait a week for an engineer for a brand new product didn't make things any better. So my first experience with AEG has not been good .......... things happen but the company needs to look at how it fixes the problems hence the 2 stars.",Approved
"Super quality fridge - the feature I like is when you put your shopping in the fridge you can press the super cool button which is timed and will then put the shopping to the same temperature as the food that is already in the fridge. Another good feature is the warning alarm if the fridge door is left ajar. 
The light in the fridge is a bright LED: the fridge also holds a lot of food stuffs: its easy to clean: the chiller drawers are good, I have found that such things as the meat and the salads seem to last longer when the appropriate chiller drawer is used. 
All in all a super fridge and as with all AEG products well designed and well made. 
Would highly recommend this product.",Approved
"Recently moved, new kitchen had to have this oven, an upgrade on what I had before. Not disappointed, even better.",Approved
I am so pleased that I bought this dryer as it is quicker and therefore more efficient that the previous brand I owned. Clothes are dry in a short time and its great for towels and bedding!,Approved
"Absolutely delighted with the AEG electric cooker. Wonderful to be able to cook as per recipes, perfect browning & heats up very quickly. Yorkshire puddings & roasties are now hassle free.
The top oven makes cooking small meals perfect, when there's just two of you. The Pizza setting is excellent & the huge tray makes homemade pizzas so easy. Not forgetting the defrost setting, sausages, fruit & meat defrosted without drying out.
Ensuring the ceramic top is kept clean is essential as sugar based sauces can stick, but it looks so nice it's a pleasure to wipe down.
Remember to keep the cable from your old electric cooker as the cooker doesn't have one supplied. Easy to install.
After limping along a 28 year cooker with no grill, one small oven & only 2 rings, I now look forward to cooking & can't wait to try something new.",Approved
Still revamping kitchen but appliance set up and gone through pre heat system as per instructions. it has been used a few times to get used to it before being removed for further decoration. I must say initially it has excelled my expectations with great hob and multi function oven so much better than previous halogen cooker. I would fully recommend this appliance.,Approved
"Very pleased with the cooker it allows me to cook in different styles including under heating only so I no longer need my slow cooker. Very easy to use and control the power. Cleaning is very simple and spills just wipe off, no more scrubbing and harsh chemicals.",Approved
"I bought this because I thought it would have the reliability of German  manufacture, and so was willing to pay a premium price for it, but was disappointed almost instantly. It's very easy to knock the buttons when cooking; they just rotate rather then click into position so the slightest knock or brush of a hand or your clothing alters the setting (and I agree with another reviewer in that the poor position also means they're constantly getting dirty). When cooking Christmas dinner, I didn't realise I had knocked a button until smoke started filling the house - I had accidentally turned the oven to thermal grilling. The turkey was spoiled and the oven was a mess. Not having had a grill in my main oven before, I wanted to know how to clean the grill and top of the oven, but there are no instructions for that in the manual. And the manual doesn't really explain the differences between the various settings, such as thermaflow and fan cooking. There are long lists of which setting to use for different foods, but if I understood the differences I wouldn't need to keep consulting lists. Thermaflow/fan cooking particularly bemuses me - they both use the fan and are the same as far as I can see. This isn't what I had come to expect from German manufacture, then I noticed an AEG email had actually come from Electrolux. I wouldn't have spent all that money had I known Electrolux were involved. At least it comes with a five year guarantee, but my hopes of a reliable cooker that lasts for twenty years or more are rapidly fading.",Rejected
"We bought this cooker to replace a Canon cooker that was 33 years old. It is more efficient and much easier to keep clean. The design is OK, but the large ring ignites at full pressure and turning the knob further turns the gas down, the opposite of what you would expect. It is also annoying that while the bottom oven tries to reignite if the gas blows out, the top one does not.
The main problem however is with keeping the ovens alight. At first we could not get the bottom oven to light at all, but found the trick is to light it with the door open and then slowly close the door. It is also necessary to close the door slowly when taking food out or putting it in, otherwise the burner will go out. The top oven is less temperamental, but it is not easy to check it has ignited.
We are getting used to the cooker now and can operate it without really thinking about these little niggles.",Approved
"Nice sized ovens, plenty of capacity for the future. 

Manual recommends closing the door when grilling, but this doesn't work correctly for the top oven, as smoke builds up inside, and does not vent as per main oven space.

Main oven options seem varied, but all are under-powered when cooking to food vendor's recommendations. For example, a pizza takes twice as long to cook than indicated, even if placed on the correct shelf as per manual. The specialist ""pizza"" setting does not improve this.",Approved
"I am very pleased with my new cooker. I chose the aeg for the style and the large grill and oven. it is typical German engineering, it does what they say it will do. I love it, I would recommend it too anyone.",Approved
"I have only had this cooker for 2 weeks and so far I am very pleased with it. It is very solid and well built. I have still to try out some of the features like the top oven. I have a slight concern about the top oven as it appears that it is heated b the same element used for the grill which I am concerned may burn soem items but I have not yet tried it so I may be wrong. 
My only other comment is that it would have been useful to have one of the normal cooking rings at the front and the simmer at the back.",Approved
"This product although expensive, is poor quality.
The hob bars have broken off due to poor wormanship.
The lower oven does not ignite always and the upper oven goes out occasionally (seems to create a lot of condensation in the oven itself).
The grill is not adjustable and therefore difficult to grill food in a controlled method (even if you lower the grill pan, which by the way does not have a handle!).
A nightmare to keep clean if you buy a Black one.
Will NEVER buy another Zanussi, stick to Cano or Belling",Approved
"All the functions are usable.They make for a dryer that ,if used correctly, almost thinks for itself. No painful static I got from all previous machines!!",Approved
This product is easy to use and looks good I am delighted with it my only criticism is the amout of steam that comes out of the vent when the oven is on,Approved
I have been pleased with the performance of the dryer. My only reservation is the rather flimsy vent tube supplied and the method of attaching it to the machine. Surely there has to be something better as it detracts from the quality of the rest of the dryer. Couldn't it at least be supplied in a way that allows it to be screw threaded on to whichever vent location the customer decides to use? P.S. That is another plus for this machine that it is offered with a choice of venting at either the back or from either side.,Approved
"I bought a gas cooker, After years of buying a different make and almost always having issues with them, burners not working correctly, oven door glass shattering, I decided to try Zanussi make, best move I""ve ever made. top quality manufacture, excellent packaging, everything works as it should!",Approved
This product although a little more expensive than your average kettle is very stylish and quick to boil. I like the temperature window. It pours well. I wish AEG would manufacture four slice toaster to match.,Approved
I was replacing a built under double oven and hob but couldn't find one where the top oven could be used as such. Many were only big enough to be used as a grill but still advertised as a second oven. This model was the only one I could find that was as large as my previous top oven. Also the grill pan is exceptionally large and can be used as a roasting pan holding enough for a large family. Having the burners set slightly lower than the cooker feels very safe when you have the four burners full. The lower oven is also large. On the whole I am extremely happy with it and would recommend this to anyone but particularly to anyone who needs masses of cooking space. It also looks really good as an appliance (I have Black). We'll done Zanussi!,Approved
"Good cooker - took me a bit of time to get used to it but getting on ok now. Top oven is great, cooks as well as the normal bottom oven - far better than my last cooker. Good seals on doors so heat retained better. Oven cooks evenly. Dials seem as if the markings will last well. Burner racks very stable - pans do not tip over, especially for my woks - used to tip over on my old cooker. The only thing I miss is the amount of oven rack positions on my old cooker but that is not too bad a draw back. Love that the grill pan is the same size as the racks so will slot in tne grooves.",Approved
I have never used dual fuel before and never liked electric ovens. However this cooker is excellent and I am very pleased with it.,Approved
Easy to use and to keep clean. Very fast cooking with good viewing window for both Grill and Oven. The deep dish roasting / grilling pan is a lovely accessory so much so I brought another one.,Approved
"Side panels seem to be weak, but otherwise the cooker is excellent, we can recommend it.",Approved
"Hob heats up on power mode amazingly quickly, turn it down and it reacts instantly. Hob very safe it will not come on when pets touch contols. ( cat walking over or dog jumping up. My dog turned on my old hob and nearly set fire to the kitchen)Door glass easy to remove for cleaning. The only complaint I have is that the feet do not wind up high enough to make it level with the existing worktop I have.",Approved
Bought thinking AEG stood for quality BUT did not work and impossible to speak to AEG direct.,Approved
"A vast number of drying options, neat design & easy to use.",Approved
"Never had an electric cooker before, have always had duel fuel, so this was a big change for me. The induction hob is amazing, literally boils water in seconds. Both ovens are large and the different cooking options are numerous. Glad I made this purchase.",Approved
"Really pleased with this cooker, it took no time at all to get used to the various features. First induction hob I've used and so happy with it. My old cooker took so long to heat up, this saves so much time.",Approved
"At long last I have managed to get a venting kit fitted, so I can now use my dryer & write this review, (it has taken weeks to get this fitted!)
I am very pleased with this dryer, it has some very useful functions and dries my clothes beautifully.",Approved
"Only had teh cooker for 4 weeks, but, so far we are very impressed.

Having come from a gas hob, we are used to good control and this is why we went for the induction. heats up very quickly and is dead easy to use.

Had to ditch most of our old pans and invest in some new, compativble ones - but, we knew that beforehand!

Oven seems to cook more evenly than our previous fan oven.

The instruction manual is a bit baffling with all the various options available for oven cooking - I dare say we will probably only ever use 2 or 3 of them, but, handy if you need them.

One odd thing is that it is quite low, so, even with feet set to maximum height then it would still be lower than out worktopns - had to resort to putting a sheet of MDF under it to raise to right heght!

Would I recommend it? So far....definitely!",Approved
"Disappointment! For the amount of money it cost I had expected something good. There is no setting for the grill, it is either on full or off. The shelves are difficult to move around, making a quick shelf adjustment too difficult to bother with. The well of the burners is unnecessarily deep and therefore difficult to get at to clean. Maybe I am disappointed because in comparison with my last gas/electric cooker bought last year for less money, better features and pyrolytic cleaning but not able to fit in this house, it is dreadful. However, to find the grill is uncontrollable is not just a poor comparison, it is negligence in a cooker of this price. I try to use the cooker as little as possible and I used to cook a lot. It is ok, yes it works, but so overpriced for what you get.",Approved
Disappointed with the explanation booklet- would be more helpful to be taken through usage step by step.,Approved
"This free-standing cooker makes an excellent addition to any kitchen. It has a smooth design with a touch screen for operation of the hob and both ovens. The bonus - no external knobs or clock which allows for easy cleaning and no more crevices where fat and dirt can accumulate. The induction aspect is great too, as it only works when the saucepan is on the ring. thus saving electricity. The only down side is that if your saucepans are as old as mine then you may have to invest in new ones in order to use the hob.
There are two ovens. The top one also being a dual grill. The main oven has lots of different functions. Apart from the obvious there is also a Thermal grilling function which I use a lot. - Grilling with the door closed keeps the food moist and stops it drying out.
I have only been using it for just under a month but am looking forward to many years of happy cooking with excellent results.",Approved
"This was a replacement for a previous AEG tumbledrier that gave 19 years good service! The new product is a bit pricier than other competitors, but I was willing to pay for the brand based on the previous model's reliable service. Build quality is very good and I am very happy with its quiet operation. The only criticism is that it is sometimes a mystery as to why the drying cycle stops before the wash is dry, and has to be re-initiated even though dry is set to maximum. AEG need to look at the automatic dry sensor and its algorithm to improve this aspect.",Approved
"This oven is designed well and the hob is so fast compared to gas. With gas I could have a shower in the morning in the time it took to boil a kettle now it’s boiled in the time it takes to put my shoes on.
I bought a second tray for the bottom oven which I feel should be included",Approved
Worth the money for a superior appliance giving us a greater cooking experience. Easy to use and easy to clean.,Approved
"We have been using it for a few days and I must say it's a huge leap in progress from our old dryer. 

This dryer is amazingly time and energy efficient. It has sensors to monitor and check how the clothes are drying and will change the time and temperature accordingly this saving time and energy. 

It's ideal for a family as it has a big load capacity so takes a good number of items of clothing. I am incredibly impressed with the build quality, the dial is robust, buttons, door and hinge are solid it feels as if it will stand years of use.

I can't recommend this highly enough, go buy one.",Rejected
"Always wanted an AEG oven and wow I wasn’t disappointed,fantastic features some I’m still finding as I don’t do instruction things!!!??? But it’s so easy to use for me and my sons both who have an interest in cooking,and now with this oven it’s got a whole lot better and exciting!!!cant wait for the future nor can my tastebuds",Approved
"Cooking has been much more controllable, even than gas. This has allowed me to give much more subtle touches in flavour and texture to my food",Approved
Once the service engineer had rectified 2 minor production faults it has been a excellent cooker.,Approved
"This produces lots of excess steam, flimsy door brackets-door doesnt catch smoothly. Oven runners flimsy, poor quality all round.",Approved
"I am extremely pleased with this cooker. I had been looking for one with an induction hob for some while but all the others I considered had design problems. The hob controls are very sensitive, having 9x2 positions and the light indicators are very clear. The induction hob is very quick and controllable. The ovens are that little bit bigger which means that a small main course and pudding can be cooked at the same time in the top oven. Both ovens heat up to temperature very quickly and there is little escape of heat. Visiibility of food inside is good. My only criticism (to date) is that the small ""ring"" (used for things which need stirring like custard or gravy) is at the back of the hob with the larger one for large pots of veg is at the front. I have not yet used all the features and will not notice the difference in fuel consumption for a while but I hope it will prove favourable compared with my old conventional cooker. Oh yes, I also think it looks very good and so do my friends. Actually I would give it 4.7 stars.",Approved
"really good looking, oven doors show offcooking, hob heats up the pans quickly much better than the ceramic ones we had before. Touch controls make top easy to wipe clean. Oven exhausts direct the steam away from the splash back.",Approved
"This cooker is superb in every way. Compared with our previous two cookers, which were gas, it really is so much better designed and very easy to control. The shelves run smoothly and quietly. The hob is so easy to clean. Heat distribution is excellent. It heats up a saucepan of water very quickly. Well done AEG.",Approved
"The induction hob is brilliant with the separate 'rings' being highly controllable and very, very fast to respond, The controls are well placed and the digital panel has the right level of information and control features. The top and bottom ovens perform well and the controls are precise. No negative points whatsoever.",Approved
"Excellent machine, great washes every time and intuitive controls.",Approved
"This was briefly a great cooker - but the hob failed after 2 weeks and Zanussi had no solution for more than a week (over christmas).

Happened on the 22nd, no engineer due until the 3rd - Epic fail with lousy customer service.",Rejected
"This machine is very quiet and fairly simple to programme.
The large door allows for easy loading.",Approved
"After my initial fault on my hob was repaired, I have had so much fun experimenting with the hob. I cannot believe how quick and clean it is. So far I have had only positive feedback from my family and friends.",Approved
"Excellent . Absolutely delighted with this.
Only little gripe is the noise when you slide the grill pan in, just grates slightly. Other than that it's damned near perfect.",Rejected
"I have barely used it. I put in one sheet duvet cover and two pillow cases. Set it to cupboard dry and it didn't even dry it enough after what seems like an eternity - to iron it let alone put it away in a cupboard! The sheets are creased to nightmare proportions. This trouble shooting facility isn't any use. I just need to speak to somebody at AEG who can talk me through how to simply dry some bed linen. Does that facility exist please, please please. It would be nice to get this wor,Int properly so that I loved it and didn't hate it - which I do right now. Help please before winter comes!!!!",Approved
"Very pleased with the purchase. Have only had it a few weeks, but it's handled all our requirements so far very well indeed. Slight whinge - the settings symbols/numbers on the knobs are written on the side of the knobs, which can make it a bit difficult to work out what it's actually set at. That said, a bit of practice and familiarity has been successful in overcoming the problem.",Approved
The double oven is ideal as it suits making smaller dishes for two but we have the option of catering for larger groups when needed!,Approved
"I love it. Shamelessly showing off to friends and they are blown away. Take a cold pan and put about 25 mm to 30 mm of cold water in it. watch it boil in around 3 minutes to 4 minutes. Reduce heat setting. Water stops boiling near instantly. Increase heat water boils again almost instantly.
Superb control. Oven temperatures so quick to reach required levels and so controllable. My daughter is replacing 12 year old cooker hob and oven with AEG",Approved
Its a beautiful design. It makes you aware when you have overloaded it,Approved
"The speed of heating of Hob, Grill, and oven is excellent Toast is evenly brown. temperatures are as indicated. However the knobs are poor in that the indicator mark is almost invisible and hard to see even with good eyesight. this is not a cooker for those with less than good eyesight. The user manual is un-clear diagrams are complex, though cooking advice is ok.",Approved
This cooker is incredible. so many features and we love the power boost options on all rings so boiling a pan of water from cold takes around 30 seconds.,Approved
"Fabulous tumble dryer - does exactly what it is supposed to do! Dries clothes quickly and leaves them smelling fresh. Our previous tumble dryer would leave clothes smelling dull, this isn't the case with the AEG. Particularly like the water collection tank for the ease of emptying. Fluff collection unit is also very good and again easy to remove and clean.

Dryness levels and the refresh setting are excellent features and adds flexibility to the tumble dryer.",Approved
"We bought this after owning a halogen cooker. This is excellent. So many features and very responsive. Easy to keep clean as well. Only complaint is that the timer is too quiet, but I can live with that. I would definitely recommend this cooker.",Approved
THE COOKER LOOKS GOOD AND FEELS GOOD .ONE SMALL NIGGLE HEAT KNOBS COULD DO WITH VERTICAL LINE ON TO INDICATE EXACTLY THE HEAT SETTING,Approved
This is the best cooker for features i have ever owned even a defrost setting,Approved
"The 2 ovens are very spacious and the hob is wonderfully quick. The controls take a bit of learning but are easy to use once mastered. However, the glass hob is very easily scratched. We purchased all new pots and pans to use with the induction hob and in less than typical use after just 2 weeks the glass hob has scratched already. I know this does not impair the function at all but is annoying never the less.",Approved
I couldn’t be more pleased with my new cooker. I wanted an induction job and delighted. It’s very fast and clean to use. The saucepan handles stay cool so are safe to use. I would recommend it to anyone.,Approved
The knobs on the cooker should have visible markers to show where they are pointing. What is the use of having invisible thick heads?,Approved
"Wow ..... just wow! What an amazing cooker. It was the first one my partner and I spotted as we walked into the store and liked the look of without even seeing the price. My last one was a different make and we wanted one that matched the quality. We left the store after purchasing it and waited for it to be delivered and installed. The installation day came soon enough and I got to work trying it out. We was amazed at how quick things heated up on the induction hob, no more waiting around for things to boil. The second day I baked a cake for the first time in years and it came out perfect! Like I said at the start ...... wow .... just wow!",Approved
"Have always used gas until I bought this electric induction cooker. It has exceeded all expectations and so far I have been delighted with it. Have had to adjust my cooking methods to get predictable results, but the guidance given in the included booklet are very reliable and a good starting point. Very expensive, but for me it was well worth the cost.",Approved
"I was looking for a cooker which had roughly the same spec as my previous one (a Tricity which lasted for 20 years!) this one just about fits the bill although there are a few shortfalls. Main oven temperatures on knob are a bit vague; for some reason the top oven ones are more precise! Otherwise all works well, heats up quickly and very controllable.",Approved
"Cooker hood extracts well, although rather noisy on fast speeds, would be better if the controls were at the front, very easy to miss the speed required when moving the control knob, as need to reach across to the back of the hood to the rear of the unit. Surprised the hood still using energy hungry lamps rather than a low energy LED lamp",Approved
Good quality and stylish design. More efficient than my previous extractor fan. Would recommend.,Approved
"I cannot fault this cooker in most areas. The hob is well designed and cooks really quickly. Both ovens come up to temperature fast and cook pretty evenly. However, the oven shelves are a nuisance as they have ridge which means that you cannot slide dishes easily in and out. I assumed that I had them in upside-down, but I did not. This should be changed. Also, the beep on the timer/programmer is simply not loud enough to alter you unless you are standing in the kitchen. My previous cooker could be adjusted to give a louder beep which was very useful. Other than these two issues I am very pleased.",Approved
This is a good machine so far. It does exactly what you expect and is not too noisy.,Approved
"Great washer dryer that saves me time and gives consistently good results clothes come out washed and dried what is there not to like.
Very happy with this purchase .",Approved
"i was so surprised how good this cooker is, i have never seen a cooker that can heat up as quick, the oven heats to 280c from cold in 14 minutes. the hobs are so responsive, when you 1st turn the hobs on they go on to the boost function, which is so much faster than gas. you turn the temp down and its almost an instant reaction in the pan.

you get two ovens both which can heat up 280c all i can say is once you get around the controls its simply a pleasure to cook on .

I would highly recommend this and have told all my friends don't look for any other this is the best , now been using it for 3 weeks now no complaints, unless forgetting about the boost when cooking beans, opps turned my head and got burnt beans, this was more my fault",Approved
"Cool design and looks really well with the rest of our oak kitchen. Love the touch button controls, no unsightly knobs gathering greasy grime. The hob heats up extremely quick when the pan is placed on it and also cools very quick when the pan is removed. Both ovens are reasonably spacious and with the use of the catalytic lining cleaning facility, it is so easy to keep clean. It's great having a conventional oven and also a fan assisted oven because it gives plenty of flexibility when cooking a meal and a nice little treat for afters. Finally, any concerns that you may have regarding quality or reliability, then personally I wouldn't worry because AEG provide a 5 year warranty with this product. Would confidently recommend to all.",Approved
Excellent product. All programmes result in a fantastical clean dishes etc The machine is quiet and easy to use.,Approved

"Induction hob is something else, I believe boils quicker and is more responsive to changes in heat settings than gas. An added bonus the heat generated is only in the pan not the kitchen, and is a lot easier to clean with no conventional knobs or buttons.
The ovens are a good size heating up very quickly.",Approved
The washer does what it says in the advert and I am very happy with the performance. The eco setting takes hours so we don't use it. The plastic guides for holding glasses on the top tray can catch the door seal so I have removed them,Approved
"The induction hob is definitely the best. It certainly beats my old ceramic hob with the rapid heat up of food. The oven with the three shelves is excellent when cooking for a family meal. The main oven heats up so quick and also liking the main oven has so many different combinations of heating up different foods. The shelves are designed to fit the oven to full width therefore with the grill you can do a larger amount of food.

This is the best cooker on the market for build quality and design.",Approved
"The first thing that strikes you is the look, which is pleasing to the eye and would not look out of place in any kitchen. It was the quality build and features of the Cooker that also won me over to purchase the Cooker, it was priced competitively which made my decision to purchase that much easier.",Approved
"Having a double oven, helps tremendously in cooking greater volume of food in less time. The distinguishing features are that both oven have additional gadgets attached to the trays (tray gliders). They help to check food whilst being cooked so easily without having to cause any spillage or accident.",Approved
"How it’s achieved I know not, but this machine is the best washer/drier I have ever owned, if for no other reason than it dries as well and as quickly as a stand-alone tumble drier. Brilliant!",Approved
"Easy to operate, operating temperatures are very good, has a modern, clean and neat appearance and it feels good quality. I would recommend this product.",Approved
"""Being limited to 55cm cookers and not many about, I opted for this one as my previous cooker was also a zanussi. I also wanted a timer, another reason to choose it. I like the fact that it has 3 shelves in the bottom and a grill pan that can be used as a shelf and a roasting tin. The ovens are a good size. Both ovens have lights, another plus factor as my previous one only had a light in the bottom oven. What I don't like about the cooker are the dials on the front. The oven dial markings are 100, 150, 200 & 250, the top oven dial has two dots between the numbers and the bottom has one dot between them. So not easy to find the correct temperature and I have to use a thermostat to find out (which I shouldn't have to do). Also there is a tiny projection on the dial, same colour, to point at the temperature and it is almost impossible to see it and has to be felt. My previous zanussi had very good knobs and markings and they were much more preferable to the one I have now. I have put tippex on the end to make them stand out more.",Approved
"Its good but Alarm sound is too low on the timer, it's useless anywhere in the house except the kitchen. What's the point ?",Approved
"We'd been looking at various hoods for a couple of months, but none had caught our eye and we felt they all looked the same. By chance, we popped into a local store to look at their kitchen displays & this AEG hood was on show. Loving the look (& the fact it was the only hood both of us agreed on), we splurged & purchased it. It is now the main feature of the kitchen & looks fab. It is a bit loud on some settings, but it does exactly what we need it to do & the dimmable lights are a fab feature.",Approved
"After much online searching for a replacement cooker having decided to go for an induction, the reviews led us to the AEG 491061U-MN, that in turn led to visiting various electrical outlets to see in it the flesh and to obtain the best deal we could. After a meticulous installation it was time then to test out the various functions of the cooker. The induction hob is a dream to operate, simple and responsive from stir fry to simmer to just keeping warm. onto the ovens, the top being also the grill, a large grill type pan with the ability to graduate the distance form the heating elements is excellent whilst the control system is so simple and controllable. The main oven having the same degree of control can cook to perfection be it fastidious baking to the Sunday joint. All in all really pleased we chose this cooker, it has lived up to our expectations and more, it is packed full of features that enable effortless cooking for all items of food, the look and build quality are excellent and the warranty, should it be needed is pice of mind.",Approved
"Looks stylish, is very quiet with ample programs and above all it washes well. The large drum capacity definitely cuts down the number of washes per week and therefor saves money, yet the process the machine runs through weighing the load and adjusting its program to suit ensures that part loads are not a waste.",Approved
Up until now I have found the cooker to be very efficient and easy to use The only downside is that the manual does not make clear how to use the bottom oven and top oven/grill at the same time. I had to ring AEG to find out if it was possible to do it.,Approved
"Very pleased with this kettle. It looks modern, has several time saving features, is easy to use and beeps when water has boiled.
When full the weight of the kettle is evenly distributed which makes handling safe and is comfortable to hold.",Approved
"The sleek style and look of this kettle is impressive & along with the low noise, quick rapid boil features are super bonuses , I’m am really pleased with this purchase.",Approved
"Cutlery basket and wire trays feel flimsy, hate layout of top rack. First dishwasher delivered without mechanism to adjust rear feet and had to be replaced. Only pro is that its quiet until it makes a load clunk noise as it opens door at end of cycle.",Approved
Got this about 2 months ago. I have tried to change the wash programme but it is stuck in programme 1. The control panel has very poor haptic feedback so it is difficult to know when you have pressed the buttons. Tried getting my friend to change the programme but still no luck. I will have to contact the engineer,Approved
"This was a panic buy and was delivered very close to Christmas. The oven was thoroughly tested from the word go. Christmas dinner and all the trimmings fitted in the oven and all cooked perfectly. Used the grill tray for the roasting, that was very handy. Cake and biscuits cooked for Boxing Day gathering. I'm still getting to know the cooker. It's easy to control, especially the induction hob. Brings water to boil very rapidly. I find getting the grill to temperature is slow but previously I was used to a gas cooker. Since Christmas I've used the top oven to cook for two people and this is very handy and is probably more economical. It is easy to keep a check on how food is cooking in both ovens due to the oven light and view through the glass. Easy to clean. All in all I think me and this cooker are all set to have a long term deep loving relationship.",Approved
Once I understood how to use it as it had completely different controls to our old one it was easy to use and washers the dishes great . I like the fact that when its on a red light shines on the floor and when its finishers the door opens.,Approved
"We are really delighted with our new Zanussi cooker.

This was bought to replace a previous model (which we were always very pleased with) and it is a great choice. We mostly have always used the top oven and this really has a great space. Loads of room for everything we will be cooking.

Very very pleased!",Approved

"This is a lovely cooker and works well. It would be much better if the clock was slightly larger and a bit brighter as it is difficult to see in a bright kitchen. Also, I have found the instruction book rather poor. It is not always easy to follow the instructions, there is no index and the grammar is not always easy to understand.

"Oven pluses include independent control of top and bottom oven timers, multiple oven options (fan/fan plus top element etc), keep warm function.
Hob pluses include bridge function, individual zone timers, Stop/Go and 'Power boost'
General pluses include the substantially intuitive user interface for the control & display of the hobs and grills, the apparent good insulation of the oven chambers (witness slow cool down times) and the venting of the ovens above the hob rather than directly out of the ovens and onto the kitchen walls).
Slight negatives are that the grill seems a little slow compared to our previous oven and the cooling fans are a touch louder than might have been expected.
Easy winners would be to include a removable handle for the pan when being used as a grill and a suitably narrow spanner for adjusting the front feet (and hence hob slope) when installing unit. Could also have you-tube of the product to showcase the attributes and plus points to people as you never get to see appliances powered up in showrooms.",Approved
Very pleased with this cooker. Lots of features and very quick heating up on the induction hob. Perhaps we were a bit naive but we didn't realise we would need to upgrade our electrics. This was an unexpected extra cost. Check if you have a high enough fuse - we needed 45amp fuse and thick wiring to cope with the high wattage.,Approved
"Whilst this cooker has some great features and operates well, it has been very poorly designed - primarily the top, which has a raised stainless steel rim which very easily scratches when moving pans aside or bringing something out of the oven to place on top. I scratched mine the very first time I used it which immediately took away the delight of having a new cooker. I can hardly tell anyone who is helping me to cook to be careful of this design fault, as a result of which, less than three weeks after its installation, it now looks very second-hand and definitely not like something 'worth' a four-figure sum! Also the top oven door doesn't open to a fully horizontal position and is so bulky when it's open it sits proud of the base of the oven, making it very difficult to position the shelves and remove a large tray from any shelf at the bottom. Additionally, when closing the top oven, it snaps shut at the last minute, easily trapping a thumb/finger, with the inevitable results.

Overall, despite its features, I don't feel this cooker is worth the money - so much so, I have already put off someone else who saw mine and was considering purchasing one and will never recommend it.",Approved
"I like my cooker, its modern looking, easy to clean and has 2 nice size ovens. What I'm not keen on is the grill as it takes a little while to ignite and only has one setting which is high. Therefore I have to stand over it as it can burn the food quite quickly. Overall it cooks the food well and I like the addition of a timer.",Approved
Grill is very poor. Heat cannot be adjusted. Grill pan has no handle and warps when heated and is then very difficult to slide in and out. I also had to have the timer alarm replaced as the first one could not be heard in the kitchen. The glass in the top oven/grill is now lose and I am not sure how to fix it. The cooker us only 5 months old. Will not buy another zanussi cooker,Approved
"Its a dishwasher, so should expect to wash dishes for a few years.
Packed up good and proper just over a year old. Pile of rubbish made to a cost, not a quality.
Wouldnt recommend",Approved
I needed a new cooker and found that in the last 24 years the quality of all cookers has deteriorated. I thought Zanussi would be OK and it looked better quality than some but it has its faults which you don't find out about until you use it. To start with the control knobs were crooked and didn't line up so that had to be corrected. The grill doesn't have a knob to control the heat so it's got to be on high all the time which means you have to keep raising or lowering by altering the shelves. A real pain and dangerous for a disabled person like myself but I didn't know about this until I bought it or I wouldn't have. The grill pan is huge and doesn't fit in the sink for cleaning so I've kept the old one from my previous cooker. The grill pan also has rough edges. Apart from that I'm happy with the oven and the hob. It isn't on castors so will be very difficult to pull out and clean behind.,Rejected
"the induction principle works very well. the hob panel is good but the gobbleydegook manual is immensely frustrating.Both grill oven and main oven are superb, BUT a detachable set of grill pan handles would be a very valuable safety accessory, cheap to manufacture and supply with a top of the range slot in cooker of this type.
I volunteer to participate in a dvd to demonstrate how to operate the control panel through its various and many functions. That way I would be able to make greater use of the cooker! I invested in Tesco Go Cook Range of Pans finding the stock pot particularly good to use on induction hob and in main oven.",Approved
"Bought this product as part of a new Redrow house build. Have always had AEG in the last 5 kitchens I have had fitted.
This dishwasher lasted just two weeks before it died completely. No power, no display - nothing. Had a qualified electrician check the electric supply and thats fine. So it must be the dishwasher, after 2 weeks and probably 10 cycles!
AEG is going rapidly down the tubes. My advice is avoid them at all costs and buy a cheaper and probably more reliable make.

"I waited until I cooked a few times before leaving this review. I have always had gas and decided to try electric. I have not been disappointed with this cooker.
PROS - It is really easy to clean, easy to use and has produced some great dishes. I love the Thermaflow fan oven and the smaller oven is so handy - great for making toast, grilling and making small cakes. The ceramic hob is a doddle to keep clean. The cooker also looks nice - the black and stainless steel look classy.
CONS - Only one, but I have sorted it out. The grill pan seemed a bit too wide and was not easy to get in and out of the oven. I got a bit of cooking oil on a kitchen towel and wiped the edges of the grill pan and the shelf position runners and the grill pan was so much easier to get in and out. Now it has been used a few times, there is no need for the cooking oil.",Approved
"I love my new Zanussi 50 cm cooker with double oven and smooth glass hob surface. However, there is a major design flaw with the grill in the upper oven. The protective metal strip which hangs down from the top of the oven prevents using the grill pan on the top shelf, if any food sits higher than the grill pan sides. This poses a danger if toast or meat curls up while under the grill, because you cannot get the grill pan out. Meat cannot be grilled at the proper 25 mm distance from the heating element, and so is overcooked and tough, even if put into the bottom of the grill pan, with no rack. Such a disappointment to the rest of the excellent design and cleaning ease of this cooker. NOTE: The 60 cm cooker does not have this design flaw, only the 50 cm cooker.",Approved

"I have only just started using this cooker due to my kitchen being refitted. Why does the clock have to be reset before the ovens can be used?

Particularly liked this cooker for the no knob flat design which makes cleaning easy. Amazingly fast to boil water in a saucepan. Some great oven features particularly adding top grilling to the fan oven. We can’t have a gas cooker but the induction hob gives near to gas control. With lots of features there is a lot to understand- my only criticism is that the timers are a difficult to get my head around.,Approved
"after having another make of washer dryer that had nothing buy problems , I chose the AEG , and what a good choice , it seems well made , and very quiet for washing and spinning , the wash comes out very clean , and when using the dry function the clothes come out nice and dry , would highly recommend a AEG machine",Approved

"Had this cooker since December and the hob is ok but the controls are very sensitive, it either boils rapidly or simmers - It takes a lot of fiddling to get the temperature right quickly.   I wish I had  bought another pyrolytic cooker instead as I do not like the catalytic liners.   The cooker has a few design faults which have caused us problems:   There are two vents on the  top of the hob (one for each oven).  When you cook anything in the ovens steam pours out of each vent and  condenses on my splash back and then runs down the wall and back of cooker.  Have resorted to mopping up every time I use the oven. I have a powerful extractor and have no problem with steam  when using the hob, just the oven.  Never had this problem with any other cooker and I have seen on other reviews that others have had the same problem.   When I contacted AEG about this they recommended covering the food  when putting it into the oven - so how do you roast anything or cook cakes?  The catalytic liners are not great and despite following the recommend cleaning cycles there are marks on the liners which cannot be removed.  Plus  the burning off process fills the house with fumes and makes the glass door dirty.  Pyrolytic cleaning was so much better and my old oven was spotless even after 10 years of use.  The auto heat settings on the hob do not work, you can wait all day, but the zone does not turn down from full power despite having the ""A"" setting.  The oven cooking is ok , but takes a long time to heat up, but the internal grill is near useless for toast or quick grilling.  Overall I would not buy this cooker again and will probably be replacing it as soon as possible for another brand.",Approved

"I own the predecessor to this appliance – the Zanussi ZRB32313WA

I initially bought this fridge, back in September 2013, because of the limited width my kitchen has available.
At 59.5cm wide, it really does ‘just’ fit into the space. (A 60cm wide fridge would be scratched if forced into the space.)

When I first started to search for a fridge-freezer, I was concerned that I would be limited to a few options, of basic machine with awful specifications and possibly cheap quality.
During my search, I found the Zanussi range offered this perfect width, but was also a high-spec’ machine (with a high energy rating of A+) but was also generous with internal space. It wasn’t cheap either at £419.99 I was buying something better than average.

I found that various sellers actually sell this same machine under variations of the same model number – the differences between each ‘version’ was as simple as the graphics stuck on the drawers, or how many plastic shelves are supplied for the fridge compartment.

The machine was bought locally from a Euronics store and was specially ordered in. It was delivered a few days later. It fitted perfectly into that 59.5cm space I had for it.
Perfect. When it use it made those ‘common’ fridge-freezer sounds, like bussing and the occasional crack. (At first these were alarming but there was a guide with the instructions that cleverly demonstrate the various noises the machine will make.)

I found the internal space fantastic for my needs:
For the fridge, a couple of bottles of wine in the rack, plenty of door shelving for my fruit juice, dairy items, and the two drawers fine for my vegetables. The rest of the trays held various other things like jams and chutneys.
For the freezer, the three drawers were great for storing meat and stock. For a single person, I could easily store a month’s work of meat and frozen veg.

Then after 7 months of use, in April 2014, the machine stopped working. I went away to a relatives on Friday night and returned on the Sunday to find the machine silent.
I opened the fridge to find it warm, and smelly – food was rotting. I opened the freezer to find it barely cold, and the meat had thawed out. All that food had to be thrown out. I wasn’t happy. I contacted the seller, who passed me onto Zanussi.
The machine has a 12-month warranty, and so an engineer came out a couple of days later. He repaired the machine within about an hour, and essentially ‘re-gassed’ the appliance. A few hours later it was all back up and running, and I could get about re-stocking it with food. All was fine.

It turned one year old in September 2014, and so the warranty expired.

At the end of November 2014, at 14 months old, I returned from a couple of nights away. It was Sunday afternoon and I returned to find machine has stopped working again. This is 7 month after the initial repair. I wasn’t happy, and also very aware that the warranty had expired.
As with the first failure, the machine was silent. Once again, the fridge was warm (warmer than the actual kitchen) and stinky. And once again, the freezer was full of thawed meat, and warm, too. And once again I threw away a lot of spoiled food.

I contacted Zanussi on the Monday morning. During that day, I made three phone-calls (each lasting around 30 minutes). I explained the problem, and was advised that an out-of-warranty service would be £115. I refused to pay this given the age of the machine, and the fact it had already failed once before. I asked to speak to someone about a replacement machine, and was advised I’d be called back. This happened for the first two phone-calls – as nobody returned my call.
The third call was pretty much the same, expect this time it was 5.15pm and most of the office had left for the day. I was given the Customer Care email address and advised to write in.

So, that Monday evening I emailed the Zanussi/Electrolux Customer Care department and explained exactly what had happened. I also sent this email to my local Euronics store as well as the main Euronics customer service email.

A week has no passed, and it’s early December (writing this review on 6th December).
In that time I have not had any response from Zanussi, nothing from Euronics, and one call from my local Euronics store that have supposedly contacted Zanussi themselves. I even contacted Zanussi UK via Facebook and Twitter, who have simply passed my contact details to the Customer care team.

Having spent over £400 on an appliance, I would expect it to last well beyond 14 months. (My previous fridge-freezer was a Hotpoint, cost £400, and lasted me 3 years before I sold it with my flat to the new owner.)
I appreciate that machines do fail, and that is why we have warranty periods, but the value of the product also implies its quality. This machine hasn’t lived up to its retail value.
Also, given the age of the appliance, the customer should not be willing to pay out £115 to repair a fault that has occurred twice. In both cases I’ve been forced to throw away food that was never reimbursed, so why should I keep losing money for a faulty product?

The appalling level of customer service is simply unprofessional. I find it infuriating that customers can be treated this way – if I treated customers in this manner, I would be fired with immediate effect.

So, given my rant, do I recommend this machine? No.
Would I look at buying anything from Zanussi again? No.

Stay away from this product, and possibly any fridge-freezer produced by Zanussi, unless you really like throwing money away and receiving the worst possible customer experience.",Rejected

"I bought this cooker in the Curry's sale and thought I was getting a bargain with £230 off the price. The cooker cost me £320 in the sale and I would be amazed if anyone actually paid £550 for it. I thought it looked good in the showroom and was a good size. on getting it home and installed I immediately noticed that there is no clock/timer. I stupidly assumed all cookers had clocks. Who in their right mind would buy one without a clock! only unobservant people like me I am guessing. In addition, the front door of the main oven is very flimsy and I am not even sure I can remove the outer glass to clean it. If I can, it isn't obvious. My final gripe is in relation to the vents at the top back of the hob. When using the oven, steam is pushed up through these vents creating condensation on the hob. This proved a big issue at xmas with both ovens on the go and all 4 rings on the hob. I felt like I was mopping up the condensation every half hour! The pots were sliding all over the hob! Would I recommend this product? NO! Would I buy it again? NO! Is it worth the reduced price? NO! and anyone that pays full price would need their head examined.",Rejected

"I'm sorry to say that my cooker was defective when delivered and required an engineer visit before the ovens could be activated. The problem was a simple one -- the left-hand side of the control pad had come adrift from the glass above. I gather from other web comments that this has happened to others -- perhaps a more secure way of attaching the pad (seems to be simply stuck down) could be found. One certainly expects better on a cooker selling at this price! 
The hob is a joy to use, very positive and responsive, as good as cooking by gas. I've only made limited use of the ovens so far but they seem to be fine. My only reservation is that the wire racks provided seem very flimsy -- bent alarmingly under the weight of a cast-iron casserole, so I thought it safer to put a thick steel baking sheet under it to spread the load",Approved

"1. Have a minimum oven temperature of 50 degrees C for plate warming/keeping food warm.
2. Have better scaling on the oven dial - it's very hard to be accurate, and this matters for a lot of my baking.
3. Improve venting from the oven - even though steam rises from the little vent at the back of the cooker I still get an unpleasant cloud of steam in my face every time I open the door. Does this explain the rapid build-up of a sticky deposite on the inside of the glass door too?
4. Have continuously-variable heat controls for the hob rings, or at least half-way stops between the six numbered settings for more precise control of simmering.
Overall I am pretty happy with this cooker, but it could be a lot better, in my view. It's all about the details!",Approved

When running a cycle the machine is very quiet and in-obtrusive in the kitchen/dinner layout of my kitchen.
The automatic door opening feature at the end of the drying cycle is a good idea, venting off steam and moisture from the washing compartment. Looks and built quality seem good to last, although the loading racks could be a little sturdier but again for the price this only to be expected.
I would definitely recommend this machine to others based on price, function and looks and the triple A+ rating.",Approved
"I have had enough of this one. My wife can do the cooking now. The hot plate knobs turn the wrong way. The grill is correct direction. You have to stay and watch the food under the grill because you have to have it closed and if it starts to burn, the first thing you know is the smoke alarm going off as you can't smell it. It has a half grill feature but that means it burns 3 edges of your toast and leaves the other under done. The element is all around the edge not one side. The grill pan sits well down from the elements. My mother nearly had a burnt face today when she opened the grill because of all the steam which shot out. The knobs are easily turned on by young children. Our son has nearly burnt himself twice. When you turn it off at the wall to stop him burning himself, there is no battery back up for the clock and so each time it needs resetting. Got the message? I am not pleased.

"Good looking cooker with clean lines. Would have preferred the edge of the hob to have not been stainless steel as I think it will be prone to scratches. The main oven door is a bit ""clunky"" when it closes. Having used this cooker for over two weeks now, I am still referring occasionally to the instruction book. I have used all hobs, the grill in the top oven , the top oven as an oven and the bottom oven as a fan oven so far. No failures so far. Each hob ""ring"" has an individual timer if required. The oven shelf supports are full depth unlike other cookers on the market, including my previous one. No more wedge shaped cakes! The top oven, when used as a grill,has to have the door closed , according to the instructions, and be used at it's highest setting so no warming of plates possible under the grill pan, when using this oven as a grill, as they would be too hot to handle and may even crack. Plenty of shelves, three plain grid shelves and the grill pan which is enormous and slides into the shelf supports as the other shelves do. Shelves ( and grill pan) are interchangeable between both ovens. The controls are easy to use and quite intuitive once you get used to them. I find putting the hob ""ring"" on power ""P"" setting to begin with and once at a boil turning down to ,say, ""10"" and after about a minute turning down to ""5"" maintains a simmer for veg etc. Turning down to ""5"" immediately seems to lose the momentum of the simmer. 
One initial problem we did have was that the cooker was tripping the RCD. The cooker supply cable was adequate but the additional current ""leakage"" from the cooker was enough to trip the RCD, which was not the case with our previous electric induction cooker. It turned out that we had an RCD which was tripping at 21mA rather than the intended 30mA and if the RCD had been functioning to specification, we would not have had a problem. Our own electrician remedied the problem.",Approved

Have had the machine for 3 months now and very pleased with the purchase. Washes and cleans very well and very quiet operation. Just a few things that can be better like the weight of the machine.

Pros: good sized main oven, larger than average top oven, ability to grill in both. Fully removable shelves and supports for cleaning.

The bridge setting to use two zones at once is useful for large pans/metal trays. Stop & Go function great to keep everything on low if needed. Separate timers for hob and both ovens. The cooker is solidly built, with triple layer glass doors. The stay clean lining extends all the way out into the door recess. 

Cons: feet too short; fully extended the cooker stands too low and we have had to stand it in a plywood base to raise it up to worktop level. The ovens also seems to need to be hotter than my old one to cook the same food (e.g. sausages at 240 degrees rather than 200). Some reviews complain about the lack of a grill pan handle.

We have had the appliance for a month and only been able to use in the last day or so as the circuit board in door and also the door latch needed replacing. Disappointing for a brand new appliance. The drying feature where the door pops open also doesn’t appear to work which is frustrating as it’s taken over 3 weeks for technician to get it working in the first place and don’t want to go through this all again!,Approved
Disappointed with the quality of this product. The shelves do not roll easily in and out of the machine and feel very flimsy. The door closure isn’t smooth and needs a good push to make it shut and the quality of the wash itself is poor particularly on dirtier dishes and smears left behind despite using required dishwasher salt and rinse aid.,Approved
"Such a nice dishwasher for my first. I have used dishwashers at other people’s homes, while at work too, but this is the first for my home. Without reading the manual I presumed that the 30 minute programme would be the most economical, but I was wrong. I couldn’t work out how the 4 hour programme could use less water and electricity than the 1/2 hour but it does.
Easy to understand instructions. Would definitely recommend.",Approved

"Based on a month's ownership, this is a simple straightforward machine which works OK. My hope is that the lack of sophisticated extras means that there is less to go wrong.

Improvements in the design that I would have wished for:

§ timing dial to rotate as time passes (had been a feature of my 1996 Zanussi)

§ users should be able to rehang the door - it must be common for people to want to change the direction of the door and it is unhelpful to expect people to incur the cost of an engineer (had been a feature of my 1996 Zanussi)

§ the machine has three settings: Cotton, Synthetics, Delicates. It is not clear what the difference is. Delicates says it is for clothing with one dot in the tumble dryer symbol, but then that seems to be what distinguishes Synthetics from Cotton. Zanussi enquiries just referred me to the manual.

§ The fixings for stacking the tumble dryer on top of a washing machine are different from those used in 1996. There must be others who are stacking new appliances over/under old ones and wish to reuse stacking kits, so it would be useful to maintain continuity of stacking connexion points as the model range evolves.",Rejected

"We purchased this tumble dryer,( the product number doesn't appear to be quite the same as mine, which is ZDCB47209W, but I cannot find that one exactly) after having a Zanussi Fridge Freezer for in excess of 20 years and 4 house moves, we thought it would be OK, quite fancied the idea of a sensor to save on the electric! Well, I have had this machine for 2 weeks and it is driving me around the bend I have resorted to shouting and screaming at it....the beeper goes off and up I get to empty it to find that the clothes are not dry, so I try to put it on again, it goes for a minute or so then beeps at me again to tell me its dry...it's not. I have tried putting it onto a programme for items that you would expect to take longer to dry, but it still beeps at me...I have now resorted to setting it to a 60 minute dry cycle and keep getting up to check it, bit pointless being a sensor model! My advice save some money and buy one that has less gadgets, that don't work anyway!",Approved
Quiet but not enough space to loadglasses with top cutlery tray. Missing a rinse only programme. Metal casing has very sharp edges lethal when installing. Previously had an AEG which was superb. What has happened to AEG quality?,Approved

I bought this oven when my 10 year old oven gave up. My Zanussi oven arrived on time and was exactly as described. The quality is very good and the oven is a good size as I easily cooked for 10 last Sunday. The temperate settings are accurate and this ovens cooks quickly. The only minor issue is the setting of the clock which can be a bit tricky but apart from that a great purchase which I am very happy with.,Approved
"Initial connection problems. Despite having no problems with our previous Belling freestanding induction hob cooker and the kitchen wiring only being 2 years old, this AEG model was tripping the RCD. Our own electrician solved the problem at the consumer unit. No kitchen wiring had to be changed. The stainless steel edging on hob will mark so another idea would have been better. I am used to an induction hob so no re-learning here but I am still referring to the instruction booklet as I use more of the options. I like the fact that you can individually time each hob ""ring"" . I find it annoying that I cannot warm plates on the base of the top oven whilst just top grilling, simply because they will literally be too hot to handle, given that you have, apparently, to use the grill on the highest setting and must have the door closed. Bottom oven door is a bit clunky. Full depth oven shelf supports are much better than the Belling or Stoves models on offer as, from experience, their oven shelves sag at the back once any weight is put on them, due to the lack of support. All successes so far. I have roasted, baked, grilled and used all hobs. I am getting used to the touch controls. I find it useful to put the hob being used straight onto the P (power) setting, waiting till the pan contents come to a boil ( which isn't long) and then turning down, first to 10 for a minute and then to 5 or 4. This seems to maintain a reasonable simmer. Turning straight down to 5 or 4 seems to be too dramatic a change and the simmer stops. Plenty of shelves supplied, 3 racks plus an enormous grill pan which is a shelf on its own and can be used in either oven. Cooker looks good. Sticker on cooker said free 5 year guarantee and I have registered my product but despite e-mailing AEG customer services, I have, as yet, not received any confirmation of this and it does not show with my details on the website. I have not had any problem with the height of the cooker. My kitchen is only 2 years old and the worktops are standard height. The four feet on the cooker are adjustable.",Approved
"I initially bought the ceramic version of this cooker after reading a significant number of positive reviews, not one review nor any website product description mentioned the cooker cooling fan runs essentially ALL the time, regardless how light the load on the cooker, just one hob on simmer triggers the fan after 6 minutes.
This cooker is not as solidly built as my 30 Year old Tricity Sovereign, it replaced.
Setting aside the cooling fan issue, the cooker operates reasonably efficiently, the lower main oven is a little close to the ground, making lifting in and out larger items a little difficult. The circulating air flow in the main oven can cook food a little unevenly if the tray is placed close to the front of the shelf. The grill is disappointing it very slow to reach temperature and lacks the split grill feature of my old Tricity.
The induction hob fitted to this model is significantly better than the standard ceramic both in terms of efficiency and controllability.
Bottom line is I regret buying this cooker.",Approved
"Your induction cooker will not work on 32 Amp cooker supply that is protected by a 30mA RCD it causes the RCD to disengage without breaking the 32Amp breaker every time the electrical supply is connected to your cooker, We had two of this type of cooker both did the same thing we had to exchange it for a standard ceramic radiant hoob cooker?

We returned both cookers and returned the free product!",Approved

"This machine has proved very effective. It has a big drum and dries very well on strong dry, delicate, no crease combinations ( which we tend to use most). Where items come out creased hang them and most creases seem to come out. To reduce duvet cover creases dry the cover on its own. It does produce shirts ready to wear if they have been washed on an anti crease cycle and dried on one and they are non or easy iron. Immediate hanging is essential.

The filters are easy to clean each time and the water container is also easy to access, although it can be unwieldy to carry if full as it is quite long.

Only negative point is the door open/close: you have to push on the correct spot to get it to click. This could be better.

"Like many people, I suppose, I purchased my Zanussi tumbler dryer because my existing one gave up the ghost. So, a bit of a rush purchase.
On the plus side, the machine looks stylish. Without the usual port-hole window in the front, the whole appearance is neater. In a kitchen run of appliances the effect is stream-lined. The controls are easy to use and there are plenty of drying options to choose from. Drying time is fast.

I do have a major gripe though. Drying a king-sized duvet cover which has an envelope style opening can be a nightmare because the whole thing gets tangled in a tight, damp ball which is hard to open out. This probably wouldn't be an issue with covers which have buttons or poppers to fasten them. But none of mine do, and I assumed because my last dryer coped admirably with the same covers, that this new one would be no different.
It does suggest that there is no forwards and reverse tumble action occuring (and I can't check because I can't see inside when the machine is running.....!) Once the cover is untangled, it is creased really badly and is very hard to iron. I have tried various drying options to no improvement. Not good.

So there it is. I would recommend Zanussi as a brand, but will do my homework next time and really pore over the small print before any purchase!",Approved

Grilling took a bit of getting used to as it is done with the door shut, but the results really are much better and quicker from our old cooker. Both ovens are a good size with the top oven being dual and the bottom oven having a fan. We were amazed at the speed both ovens got up to temperature and it even beeps to let you know.

"A disaster to start with. We could not get the oven to work. ( The hob worked well). We read and reread the manual, sent an email to the help line and viewed u tube to no avail. Phoned AEG. An engineer was sent and he could not get the oven . He said that the cooker needed a replacement circuit board. I phoned my cooker supplier, Appliance City. Appliance city offered me a new cooker but said that tgey needed to contact AEG. I waited several days, periodically reading the manual and trying everything I could think of. 
I noticed that if there was a pan under heating on the hob I could get the oven display to stay on long enough to adjust the oven and get it to work, but as soon as the heat from the hob was switched off the cooker display went off.
After a few days using the hob I disabled the child lock on the hob. Amazingly I could not get the oven controls on and could use the oven properly. Strange, but the everything on the cooker worked properly. Appliance City phoned me and said that AEG would repair my new cooker when legally they should have offered to replace it.

I also bought the cooker when there was an offer of a £100 cash back from AEG. I repeatedly applied online to get this but for some reason this was refused! I could not understand this and have applied by post for the cash back.

"A great looking cooker. V large oven with choice of conventional or fan. The reason we chose it.

The touch controls were a nightmare. Far too sensitive and wiping any spills caused rings/ovens to go off/alter settings/change functions.
Could not see at a glance the oven temperatures if both on together, likewise the grill/main oven.
No half grill.No handle for grill pan.No separate roasting pan.
The timer also caused major problems in that when the countdown had reached zero the whole cooker switched off after a few seconds.It only counted upto 99 mins 59 secs.Not long enough for some cakes/roasts/caseroles.

"Bought from John Lewis, Cardiff on 14th August 2018 and took delivery on 29th. Then had to modify the kitchen as the purchase was to replace a gas hob with an under fitted oven. Once the new appliance was connected it was found to be faulty. The hob worked perfectly but the oven controls were dead. Contacted AEG and they immediately arranged for a service visit. Oven now works fine and I will provide a further review after I have used the ovens a few times.",Rejected

"We like the design. 
Most of all we like the flexibilities of the cooker rings, especially the fast 'heat' function and the ability to really control the simmer. This is the best experience we have had ever with an electric cooker. Although the cooker has the same outside measurements as our previous cooker the AEG gives almost a 50% increase in oven space , in both ovens. The touch controls whilst very different from 'knobs' are easy to understand and to operate.
Build quality, after three weeks usage, seems good. We would suggest that the shelves need to be made from a thicker gauge steel as they 'sag' a little under the weight of a chicken brick.",Approved
We were pleased with the cooker when it arrived May 2016. It heats up fast and is quiet in operation even with the main oven fan working. However the catalytic liner in the main over developed a wide split in one corner and AEG replaced it under warranty. Sadly the problems were not over. The replacement cooker has a door that does not fit. Heat and fan noise are escaping from the badly fitting door. The catalytic liner has split again in the same place. The oven control lights don't show a progress bar to indicate how close the oven is to reaching temperature - as its predecessor did and as the manual says it should. We placed a service call Dec 2015 and the problems are still not resolved two months later. The manufacturer doesn't speak to customers or handle service calls but passes them to a third party repair service and then the third party and AEG don't communicate.,Rejected
"The cooker was ordered on the 29th Jan, delivered on the 8th Feb (after chasing), and I am still waiting for an engineer to come and make the thermofan oven usable, when you turn on the fan it sounds as if the oven is taking off. Have not been able to get hold of AEG and Curry's just passed me over to a service shop. Not impressed, I feel that I just have an enormously expensive accessory sat in the kitchen.
Furthermore could not register the appliance on line or by phone as the 5 year warranty was not recognised.
I may revisit the reviews and update this if and when it gets sorted out but at the moment I would steer clear of AEG.",Rejected
It is a very well designed fridge: it is spacious inside (we have taken out one shelf to store more big items and everything still fits). There are 2 enormous veggies sections at the bottom. I like temp control panel. One very big shortage is the noise it is making. It is really loud despite being A++ and one of the latest models (expensive one!). Engineers should rethink this as currently it is not doing great on that front.,Approved

"I love my new cooker. I have never had an induction hob before, but I love it. Really quick to heat and easy to control. The oven is a little cooler than my last one, so it takes a bit of adjustment. The only drawback is if you are cooking many dishes, e.g. Christmas Day, then the hob loses power, as it is diverted to the ovens.

"The hob is excellent it took me a few weeks to get use to the speed that it heats up almost instant, ( no time to chop your onions while the pan heats up) as is the control of the heat so food boiling over rarely happens but when it does it never burns on the hob, which means no more time spent scrapping burned food off, just a quick wipe over is all it ever needs. I love the way the two ovens heat up so quickly also the different settings for cooking your foods I find gives excellent results. The grill I agree with an other review that it seems to bake rather than grill but I find if you leave the door open you can over come this. My only real gripe are the cooker shelves. I hate the basket shape which means you can not slide trays in or out, I just cannot get use to them I find them so awkward I have ended up burning myself on several occasions, also because of the limited shelve positions at the sides, even though it is a very large oven it is hard to get three shelves spaced, something I could do with my smaller previous oven. But over all a luxurious cooker for the chef in the family.",Approved

"We bought this to replace our Bosch unit which had lasted 12 years and after 3 weeks of ownership we are really disappointed. The ergonomics of the internals, specifically the design of the top basket and the positioning of the plate racks in the lower basket renders it almost impossible to load the machine in an effective and efficient manner. Cups and glasses fall over in the top tray when placed on the angled side sections - the rack just isn't designed well at all - and any movement in/out of the basket on its runners causes items to move about in an uncontrolled manner. It's just a very poor design in comparison to the Bosch item.

Features are as you would expect from a modern dishwasher and it offers a range of programmes to suit but the ECO programme takes over 3 hours! Cleaning performance is a bit patchy and we find that we have to rinse the dishes more before placing them in the washer, which defeats its purpose.

I wouldn't recommend this unless you like the daily challenge of loading something awakward and unfit for purpose.",Approved

"Overall excellent, but very disappointed this cooker does not feature a halogen grill, the conventional grill in this oven is very slow in comparison to the halogen grills in my previous cookers, and does not perform anywhere near as well, (I find it seems to dry-out/bake the food rather than grill it) the grill pan provided is also ridiculously large and unwieldy, so much so that I have abandoned using it and replaced it with the one I retained from my old cooker
Otherwise, I am very happy with the performance. The induction hob is superfast and instantly heat control adjustable. The multi function oven is also brilliant.
The build quality is impressive and aesthetically pleasing. It is obviously very well insulated (I no longer avoid using the oven on hot days, as I have in the past, due to the build-up of heat in the kitchen) and there is minimal blast of heat when opening the oven door.
Why oh why in a cooker of this quality and price, with so many advanced features, was it not fitted with an equally advanced and efficient grill?",Approved

"This freezer is used alongside our AEG fridge freezer which is of the big fridge/small freezer variety. It lives in the utility room and just gets on with its job totally hassle free. The old freezer thermostat went and it was running all the time so I needed to replace it quickly. I fancied a Miele but found they were made by Liebherr so went to my local dealer for one of those. He recommended the AEG, had one in stock and followed me home with it to fit it. First impression in the shop was of rock solid quality and reliability. It was soon ready for action and has performed effortlessly and efficiently since. It has a lot more drawers than our other and this saves a lot of grovelling around, you can see what’s in them easily and they slide easily and give the impression that they will do for many years. It’s not sculpture, it’s plain, clean white and it works itself without the need for a thousand dials and buttons. It is exactly what I wanted. It was dearer than some but none came close for quality.",Approved

"Would recommend, it can be a bit noisy though when in operation",Approved
"We bought this dishwasher based on Which?'s recommendation
It is certainly very good and nowhere near as noisy as we were led to believe it would be.
However, like many other dishwashers, the 12 place setting is a bit notional - if your plates and dishes are perfectly flat then you could probably put 12 settings in but as our plates not flat but slightly dished it doesn't take 12 settings - as soon as you add pans, baking trays etc to the mix things get worse.
The cutlery holder always seems to come out dripping for some reason and really crusty dishes (after baking for instance), need pre-cleaning. Our china tea mugs have a dished bottom so they always retain water in the dishwasher. There is no adequate place for fish slices, tin openers, large serving spoons, etc.
Having said all that it is a great dishwasher and we are very pleased with it - it's certainly no worse, and probably far better, than many dishwashers around today.",Approved
"After learning how to touch and tune into how the controls work, on the whole we have had successful cooking.
Heating up is so quick both on the rings and ovens.
When using the fan oven to do my usual roast, I ignore putting the temperature down by 20degs. 
It is rather disconcerting that when cooking with both ovens, you switch off the one you have finished with and both go off. You have to quickly boot up the one you are still useing!!
I wish the timer would do several hours as did my old AEG. The ping should be a lot louder. I have now bought a timer that does several hours at a time and pings louder.",Approved
"First disappointment was that if you switch off at the mains at night as recommended by most H&S experts, when switched back on you must reset clock before use. This is either to save cost of battery backup or poor engineering but this is suppose to be a premium product?
The induction rings will heat very fast on maximum power but then to simmer the control is very difficult as settings are not linear and below 8 it appears to do very little.
The cooker is also rather low and we had to extend the feet to maximum and is still not fully level with our work surface. Our old cooker had rollers at back which allowed it to moved out for cleaning but now concerned about moving this out in case it damages the extended fixed feet.
The top oven door gives impression of large size but in fact the actual roof is quite low to the exposed heating element",Approved

After my previous freezer went wrong for the third time in 3 years I decided to replace it with this one and I am pleased I did.

Time will tell but it did come with an extended warrenty.,Approved
All good - I have no adverse comments. Drawers are supported on rollers - not fitted to my previous freezer,Approved
"After surveying several freezers I opted for this particular freezer because it was the only one on the market that had roller tracks fitted to the drawers.
Unfortunately after installation and when in use the drawer rollers do not stay on the tracks when opening and closing.
This appears to be a design fault whereby the roller each side of a drawer are not spread wide enough to sit firmly on the track runner.
Having then dropped of the track the drawer then jams on the side and is very difficult to continue to pull out or push back.
As it happens each time it is very annoying and we have now lost faith in the product",Approved
"This is a good size freezer which accommodates a large amount of freezable food goods. With a good selection of drop down and slide out drawers and the benefit of a self close door, fast freeze facility, bright internal light and easy controls we believe this model to be a good investment, however with all electrical appliance only time will tell. When delivered the door opened on the wrong side for us, although with the clear instructions provided, and the correct tools, I was able to change it over within a short period of time (I would however advise buyers to ask their supplier to carry out this service for them either prior to or when delivered). One additional feature we believe to be beneficial is the very secure full length door handle. Our last freezer had a weakness in this area prompting the need for replacements only due to the occasional heavy vacuum created within the freezer when the door is open for long periods of time and over stressing the handle when trying to open. This freezer seems extremely good value for the price considering you could pay much more for less quality just for a fancy name badge!",Approved
Love the new Hob - the added functionality of bringing a pan to boiling and then automatically dropping it to a set temperature saves having to watch over it.  I also like the added functionality of the Timer in being able to “count up” as well as down.  The big step however is being able to link areas of the hob - giving much more flexibility.  Not sure what more they can add!  Loved my old one - love this even more!,Approved
"While a smart looking freezer it failed within 2 weeks of connection. In outline when it failed the alarm sounded and the warning light flashed. The hand book interprets this as the door left open. At this point the temperature indicated minus 15 deg. The instruction is to cancel the alarm. The issue is that the temperature readout remains at -15 deg and does not show the true temperature in the freezer. The next day with the alarm flashing but still showing -15 deg I opened the freezer and the contents were spoiled. The service department inspected the freezer and it had suffered a system fault that required a complete drain, flush through, seal, recharge and a new compressor; 3-4 hours work in situ. The freezer had been connected for 2 weeks. The issue is ongoing. The Freezer was delivered as part of a large order for a kitchen rebuild and was held in storage in packaging for 5 weeks prior to connection.

"I was looking for a matched pair of tall freezer and fridge and considered many makes but settled on this model, I had read a couple of comments about the noise it makes in operation but can tell you ours is absolutely silent, in fact I have to keep checking it is actually running.
In terms of style it looks fantastic and shows no finger prints on the stainless steel door.
The only criticism I have about this purchase is the instructions are virtually non existent, a flimsy couple of pages with generic pictures and very little text.

"This is written during first week of operation, 
Unit comes nicely protected ,unpacked and investigated by common sense cause as usual the handbook is average which is what you expect these days partly due to bad translation partly due to well just missing.
On switching on unit is quiet but appears to be slow to cool - it took 4 hrs to remove 30 deg of air down to -18 . The most disappointing thing is the display always shows the temp set point Not the actual temp. It also appears that the electronic control is very course (seams to be operating on a remote meter +-3deg on setpoint). In fact the whole interface could be designed better.
Internally nice, build quality satisfactory but the draws looked like there cracked due to the production design , there not. the light is good, and the draws free running and large .

This is a fab little cleaner. Very powerful and great for those small cleaning jobs around the house. I use it on carpets and laminate floors and it picks up the dirt and dust wonderfully. I don't use the handheld cleaner very often but when I do it is very convenient as I no longer need to charge 2 Hoovers. It is lightweight (main reason for buying) and means my upright cleaner is used less. Very pleased with my purchase.,Approved
"I bought this Hoover from Currys about 10 - 12 months ago , it seemed ok for the first few weeks although the accessories given with it are a complete waste of time, small brush, which when applied looses suction and what I can only describe as the most useless awkward attachment ever a nossle that you have to push open to get any suction at all.
The Hoover is very heavy, loosing suction very easy, the bare floor option is useless, very little suction if any, if you use on a carpet with longer pile it stops working taking ages to come back on, general pick up is bad, I have to go over the area several times, Cleaning the stair is back breaking as the tools supplied don't work so I have to brush the stair down first. When you use the swivel feature the tools fall off.Only positive it looks good and has little lights.
I would have returned it however I have lost my receipt , I refuse to call, the help line as it is a premium number and will cost a fortune from my mobile",Rejected

"We had our kitchen redesigned and fitted with Zanussi products including double oven, induction hob and canopy. The Zanussi ZE16240FBA induction hob that I had purchased from John Lewis had to be replaced 3 times. On the first hob installation, the electrician stated that the hob was faulty and did not work at all. The replacement had the same issues. On the third attempt, the hob worked! The Zanussi electrician installer (From B and R services) said that the 6mm twin and earth cable was sufficient to use but recommended the H05BB-F cable (which I later found out, only comes in 1 metre lengths).
All was going well until 9 months, when the hob was showing signs of fault, it was turning itself off and on and was unable to operate. The electrician said to replace the cable with the recommended one. I immediately ordered one from the supplier at £35 including VAT and postage, cable length wasn't stated but a local outlet thought it should be a lot of cable for that price! Upon receiving and positioning the cable, I later found out that I need a longer length of cable and two can not be connected together as it invalidates the guarantee.
Zanussi are replacing the hob for a fourth time hoping it will last. The existing cable isn't an issue as it works fine delivering 240v even when the unit cuts out.",Rejected

"I have had one of these before, but liking the new features. I am a very lazy cleaner and if something is awkward I will not do it. The lightweight cordless feature of the vacuum really appealed to me because even if I intend to clean a small area the cleaner makes me want to continue cleaning my whole home and I always loved the light feature for cleaning dark areas and for cleaning at night. The new self-standing feature comes in really handy because I am often dashing off to answer the phone or use the bathroom mid-cleaning and now I can leave it in the middle of the room as it stands up on its own. Efficient use of suction facilities as I like having the choice of super suction or less suction for light cleaning. 

Overall a tidy cleaner that does not take up a lot of room in my small flat and effortless emptying of the cleaner once full. I also have a mountain of hair that seems to accumulate on my carpet and the brushroll clean facility makes hair removal very easy. The battery gives a good charge and enough time to clean my flat and the handheld cleaner is perfect for kitchen work surfaces, sofas and removing crumbs from my computer keyboard.

All in all a great machine.

The only cons I found was that I had some difficulty assembling this models handle and attaching it to the lower part of the cleaner. The wire seemed longer than needed inside and I did struggle a bit, but once on it works like clockwork.

Very pleased!",Approved

"This vacuum is so much lighter then my 'lightweight' mains cable Dyson. With no cable to keep unplugging and tripping over, this makes vacuuming so much easier.

That, together with the fact that you can separated the chamber and use it as a separate 'dustbuster', makes this little wonder a must for anyone who is looking to make vacuuming chores easier. Having a light in the head, makes it easier to clean in dark corners as well! The facility that cleans the brushes when they get entangled with hairs etc is unusual and effective.",Approved
"I fitted this today. I had realised it would require steel pans and that my wok and one or two other pans wouldn't work. I tested it by boiling water in various pans including the frying pan and my 30-year-old le Creuset casserole. The water boils very quickly and can then be adjusted to simmer rolling or stay hot just by changing the numbers, I have always favoured gas because of its adjustability and ability to deliver very high heat but I reckon this beats gas. I cooked dinner on it tonight, the pan handles don't get hot and there is much less steam in the kitchen. I can't comment on reliability on day one but I am probably already a convert to induction.
It is sensitive to pan size and one of my steel pans is 'too small"" to register so gets ignored; but the hob does display an 'F' to warn me.",Approved
"I love my AG3012, it sits pride of place in my home ready to quickly clear up any dust or dirt. It is so lightweight and easy to use, the 180 degree head means I can whizz around my home with no problem.

My living room is carpeted and my kitchen is vinyl, the great thing about this product is I can move through rooms with no problem and the suction is great on both floor types. My favourite feature is the pop out handheld element, its powerful and so convenient when clearing any crumbs or dust. The handy tools make it even easier, sometimes I use the handheld unit and crevice nozzle to get to the difficult places in my car. The brush roll clean saves me the job of clearing the dusting brush of my hair (a job that I hate!) its unique and so efficient. I would definitely recommend this product.",Rejected
I don't like cleaning but this machines makes you jump up and fix a mess quickly. I have had it for 6 months now it was my first cordless floor cleaning product and I though the novelty would wear off. It looks solid and presentable to leave out but we keep it on charge in the cupboard. Its a real game changer of a product the family enjoy using it even though we have a power cable cylinder vac this has made a helpful addition. Its light and the 2-in-1 handheld really doubles the value.,Rejected

"This is our first touch control hob, and very good we think it is too. The fitting was truly easy, once the instruction were read and understood. Using the little brass two pole conductor was a very easy answer to coupling up the two live connections. Then once the supplied surface gasket was added to the hob it was just case of easing it into place and presto. A doddle.
The only minor gripe is removing greasy finger marks! But a minor problem for what we think is a very reasonably priced electric hob.
Zanussi you've made cooking easy.

The hob was used throughout, what was a very busy Christmas for us and performed extremely well. Sometimes with all rings being used on more than one occasion and with plenty of room for some large frying pans to be used at once.",Approved

I live in a first floor maisonette so need something that will cope with stairs,this makes it so easy it's light enough to carry & the whole unit fits on the stairs, we also have a stair lift so the handheld really comes into its own to get behind the rails. Not only is this great for stairs but for all the usual vacuuming as well it's so quick and easy to use & is easily as powerful as my last hoover(hoover) not only that everyone wants to play with it so my carpets have never been so clean, can do the whole flat easily (2bedrooms) on 1 charge.

I live in a large 3 story house which means using 2 vacuum cleaners located at different levels. I wanted an efficient cleaner that did away with the need for constant changing of sockets. I researched the whole of the Dyson range and found it expensive and battery life far too short. I found this cleaner by accident. It's fantastic. I can clean the whole of the house in under 30 minutes. It is so light and easy to use. it's true it does not have accessories but I can use those on the conventional cleaners. The house gets cleaned far more often than before so looks better and I'm not as exhausted as before! Make sure the cleaner is charged for 24 hours before first use. Brilliant.,Approved
"I was optimistic as some other review sites complained of a poor battery life. However, I must completely disagree. The battery has not failed on me (yet) and it is excellent for picking up fine dust hidden in your carpet.
Two tips i have for any future buyers is to give the Vacuum time. What I mean is once you switch the hoover off, allow it to fully stop before you place it on the stand, otherwise a red light flashes and it does not charge properly. Another thing, when switching the hoover on for the first time in a while, allow it to ""warm up"" before you put it on the highest setting. If you don't do this, it stops and the light flashes red again.
This leads me to the three speed settings which are amazing! There is the fast setting, then the average setting which is always the first speed that you get when you switch the hoover on. Then the slow setting, I call this the ""quiet setting"" because it is so quiet! I use this setting for everything as it does the job fine.
As I said before, the hoover is great for fine dust particles. I had to empty mine twice in two days because it was (shamefully) full of dust.
One last thing is the hair removal button which somehow cuts all hairs tangled round the brush. I think this is an amazing idea and it works like a dream.",Approved

"Our first Zanussi freezer lasted 15 years. Our second lasted 8. This has lasted just over 2 years. Disappointed!
It has groaned and made ominous creaking and cracking noises since new. We put it down to the model. The very bright green light was interesting and illuminated the kitchen at night! Operating problems started at about month 13 (just out of manufacturer's guarantee!). Ice built up at the bottom of the compartment and had to be cleared regularly. Then the temperature alert buzzer and light came on. Despite supper cooling, eventually it ceased to maintain a low temperature and has now failed completely.
Yes, it might be low cost, it might look good but I hope that our experience isn't typical of the model. So here we are, just before Christmas, having to get a new freezer! Do we buy another Zanussi .. to go with our Zanussi washing machine, dishwasher and fridge...mmmm..not sure, just sad!",Approved
"Had brilliant previous model for 10 years. This new version ( Model # 49176V-MN, with the black steam vents) results in steam hitting the wall above the cooker, causing condensed water to run down behind the cooker onto a wood floor. This is in a warm kitchen with an extractor fan above cooker. It was so bad that I thought that the vent pipe had become disconnected, but the engineer said that was not the case. Pulling the cooker forward by 2cm as he suggested does not solve the problem. I suggest that this appliance is not fit for purpose and the vents need properly redesigning. As it stands it cannot even cope with cooking a cake. Have I got a rogue cooker, or is this just a very poor redesign? Personally, I also dislike the new 'safety' shelves as they are far more difficult for a child to use, as you cannot just slide a tray in or out of the oven.",Approved

"Only concern is battery life. Previous machine was AEG 25.2V vacuum cleaner and was an excellent machine. New machine shows every sign of being an improvement. Light and easy to use, easy to clean and battery charge more than long enough for our 3-bed house upstairs and downstairs. Unable to replace battery on new machine, so does it go into landfill in 2-3 years. Previous machine battery lasted approx 1.5 years, but could be renewed.

"The front pan supports are too small and not central over the burner, meaning pans are unstable and can tilt forward and tip boiling contents on to the floor.

None of the burners can be turned down sufficiently to allow a slow simmer.

Three burners have to be held down for 3-4 seconds before they remain lit. One needs to be held down for about 7 seconds before it remains lit. The engineer who visited regarding this said this is fine and refused to replace the thermocouples.

I was sent a satisfaction survey for this hob which I completed. It asked if I would like to be contacted regarding my complaint. I said yes, but no-one has contacted me, even though this was two or three weeks ago.

I have called Zanussi but struggled to find an option to speak to anyone. I got stuck in a loop being asked the same automated question over and over again with no option to back track and try a different option. Eventually Zanussi ended the call. 

When I eventually achieve contact with Zanussi I will be seeking a full refund for the purchase and installation.",Rejected

"The look and feel of the product is of good quality, however it does have a design problem.
The front pan supports are not large enough when using all burners together as the pan support is cut back to allow the hob controls to be accessed.

"Misleading reviews online warrant me to review this product since the purchase of it reveals a rather well thought out hand held cordless vacuum. The models by AEG that pick up water seem to do well with a lower battery power compared to this dry suction only cordless version but it comes with built in features that the wet and dry versions lack.

A pull clean mechanism on the filter prevents me from having to empty the bin all of the time; something the wet and dry version lacks. The crevice tool is built in, unlike the clip on version with the wet and dry versions.

There are limitations though.

It will not clean out your car - the suction channel is too narrow for that kind of dirt.

It will not clean up pet hair - there is no brush roller at the front to cope with this.

Instead this can shift the odd cob well or the breakfast crumbs off the table, kitchen dirt on worktops and the odd quick clean if you have been eating on the sofa. It is very light for me to hold onto - without agony.

The instructions are clear enough for me - all pictorial diagrams and no need to read poorly written languages like other brands. Simplicity follows the design of this AEG well. The slide out medium length crevice is a nice thought, helped by a clip on slide in and lock optional use dust brush that won't get lost over time due to the rather handy space on the charger for space storing when not in use.

Suction is strong enough for me when there are two speeds; high and low. The AEG AG6106 picks up dirt instantly and the handle has two handling positions that reinforce the lightness of the whole body.

I love the fact that it only takes 4 hours to charge although I find 3 hours is enough for the amount of use it gets. The run time is okay for what I need - I don't spend the suggested 14-16 minutes cleaning with a hand held vacuum.

But it does pick up dirt caused by quick messes.

LED lights are easy to work out - there's a charge light and another light that shows when the battery has been fully charged. (c)NR2 2015.",Approved

"I am happy with this oven. This is my second Zanussi Oven and the features are more or less the same. Basic features make this oven very easy to use and, for me, all I need.

Gets up to temperature quickly. Economy grill is very useful when just grilling small measures. Large oven space is great and the side opening door an absolute joy-no more burnt elbows trying to remove dishes.

Easy to clean glass door. I am not a lover of self-cleaning sides, but I can live with them.",Approved
"This oven is on the whole really good, it 's only bad point in my opinion is that you do have to make sure you position the knob that details what procedure you wish to use in the right position. Can be rather trickey to get used to at first.",Approved
"My first impression of this product was a well made item, and it lived up to my expectations, didn’t realise how much dirt it had picked up but had to empty it after doing two staircases.",Approved
"Would like to have given this product a higher rating. The controls are easy to use, it is smart, comes with 2 shelves and a full-size grill/roasting pan, removable internal glass pane for easier cleaning, and big capacity. The oven works very well. It warms up quickly, cooks evenly and quickly, and the external cooling fan is impressively quiet.
However, I was disappointed with the grill. The problem is the design of the element, which is more of a ring around the edge of the oven cavity, with very little of the element in the centre - which is exactly where it is needed the most. Doh!",Approved
"Excellent built in cooker,looks good,has knobs that push in flush when not in use. Has a larger than normal top oven that's OK for most weekly meals. Large main fan oven works brilliantly with all its functions. Easy clean linings. Comes with 3 shelf's that can be used in both ovens and 1 grill/oven pan,not a grill pan with handles,this was bought seperatly. We are very pleased with it so far(installed in July).",Approved
"Excellent cooker but it is extraordinary that the cooling fan below the cooker controls appears designed to blow the maximum air straight into the users face/eyes. A simple deflector sending the air down between the glass of the two doors and out at the bottom would be ideal solution, increasing the cooling effect on the doors at the same time as removing this unpleasant/annoying feature.",Approved
"Bad point is that the outer gauze filter could do with being more securely fixed to the inner finer dust filter this is not a huge problem though.
My 2 ladies say that the vacuum unit can fall over when using the hose but in my opinion if the unit is held with one hand and the hose with the other it is absolutely fine and sucks up lovely.
Our first one had to be exchanged (top marks to ao.com was almost instant) as soon as we used it as it cut out whilst vacuuming but the 2nd one has so far been perfectly ok probably because the factory makes so many that a few will be faulty like anything else in life!
It is a great little machine and much better compared to rechargeable vacuums.",Rejected

"We chose Zanussi because of its name and reputation as being a qualitty company to buy from, unfortunately the double oven i bought ZOE35511X does not live up to the name, It has only one rack in the whole of the double oven which tilts when you try to take out your red hot tray, making this dangerous,and it isn't a level rack, it dips all the way round, making it awkward to lift any trays out,
The grill tray is ok but slides in the side of the oven making it impossible to cook anything else in the oven, as it takes up so much room.
To top it all off you cannot buy accessories to replace the racks either on Zanussi site or the itnternet",Rejected

The best car vacuum that I’ve had. Just wish the nozzle part was a bit longer,Approved
"I bought this vacuum cleaner for my stairs after my other one died, and I cannot believe the difference - this one is so much better! I used to get hot and stressed doing the stairs and now it is so easy. This vacuum cleaner is really powerful and the ‘strong brush’ feature is a real winner - it restores the pile and brings new life back in to the carpet. It is also lightweight and the cable is nice and long so it can easily reach to the top of the stairs. It is also really good at getting the edges of the carpet where it meets the wall - I didn’t really need to use the attachment at all. I can definitely recommend this product.",Approved
"The vacuum cleaner works well on general dust etc found in the car. It is powerful enough to suck up dust and grit. I also used it in the loft - it is small enough to lift up there and the cord is long enough so I can reach where I need to go.
The slight disaster I had with it was when I tried using it to suck up spilled toner in my laser printer. The toner dust was so fine that it went straight through the filter and out of the exhaust, sending yellow dust all over the room! I tried using my main vacuum cleaner and that clearly has much better filters that captured the dust.",Approved

"This product is good, does what is expected but the lack of a manual or any meaningful documentation is a real black mark against the product. I purchased the stream cleaner recently and it comes with two cloth pads for cleaning. I don't know why there is two, what is the difference between the two and when should I use either. I don't know if they are machine washable after use. The steam cleaner came with a strap, this is not mentioned anywhere is the miserable one page picture instructions. I telephone Zanussi looking for better instructions and I was wasting my time. They sent me a manual for an Electorlux model which wasn't any better than what I already had and I had to push for this, I was being fobbed off. Very disappointed with the response from Zanussi and it would stop me from purchasing any of their products again.",Rejected
"Need to get used to the fact that most dishes are placed in the bottom of the oven (shelf 1) even when grill is being used rather than at the top. For example, this seems to be contrary to previous oven when grilling sausages. Changing clock function is a bit confusing when in oven in use. Also it is not easy to see what the current temperature is without 'twiddling' with the right hand control. Lastly, guide book is silent on simple tasks, like grilling sausages",Approved
"I thought I'd done all my homework when I chose this from the fridges that Magnet had on offer when I bought my kitchen. Clearly not.
First, this is not frost-free.
Second, the fridge is very small
Third, the drawer on the same side as the door cannot be pulled out fully. To remove the drawer entirely, you would need to also remove the other drawer. In addition, the drawers pull out at an upward angle which means their contents is always sloping away from you.

I found the best feature to be the very responsive heat level controls - it also delivers on speed of performance.I would have preferred a slightly smaller large cooking area on r/h side - with just two of us we rarely need to use this area unless using a steamer or very large stew-pot/casserole so its a bit of a waste of space but would probably be suitable for larger families.,Approved

"We bought this Which? Best Buy oven and installed this in our new kitchen ourselves (legally as it was a straight swap) several weeks ago and so far so good. It looks good and is stylish with a large capacity. However, it took us nearly 2 hours to work out how to open the plastic wiring connection box without breaking it (as the installation instructions do not explain this). Also, when you start cooking, a count-up timer automatically starts up in the display (showing how long the oven has been on) and there does not seem to be any way of disabling this rather annoying function. The problem here is that the time that the oven has been on is not usually the actual cooking time as it obviously includes the time that the oven takes to reach the required temperature before the food to be cooked is put in the oven. Even if you cannot disable this function, a neat solution to this problem would have been to be able to reset the timer to zero at any stage during the cooking process.",Rejected

With four children, we use the oven a lot and you can pay a great deal more money if you want - but I personally don't see the point. It is nice and large and comes with all the racks you will need.

It isn't ""safe"" at all - this oven has driven my blood pressure up to very unsafe levels!

"Bought this oven based on the experience of owning AEG washer/dryers and was not disappointed. Compared with my previous oven, (Not AEG), this basic model satisfies the basic requirements and then some.

The temp accuracy is a real benefit and the pyro cleaning function is a real boon, its just a shame u have to remove the shelves and runners ahead of using this fantastic feature but I guess its normal to have to do this.

The only quality issue is one shared with some other manufactures at this price point and that is the rather flimsy feel to the control knobs when using, they wobble on their shafts which is a little disappointing.

Overall though I would say i am very satisfied and would recommend AEG as one of the best manufactures and most price points",Approved
"I am very disappointed with the freezer volume of the similar model ZRB32312WA. . Zanussi claim 110 L gross capacity and 92 L net capacity. My estimation is about 80 L gross volume without the drawers and only 55 L usable volume with the drawers. I note that Which estimates 60L. The low usable volume is due to the design of the drawers. They are too small and the ridiculous curved shape makes it impossible to load packages efficiently, although it probably helps speed up cooling. I have complained about the misleading specification to Zanussi, but so far the only response has been to restate the factory figures which are surely wrong. I bought this model from an internet supplier without pre-inspection because it was not on sale in any shops. It was one of the few models which was the right size for my kitchen space. I wish that I could have inspected it beforehand. Watch out if buying similar current Zanussi models which claim 110 L freezer capacity such as this one.",Rejected

"AEG Induction Hob IKB64301FB: Having never owned an induction hob before I was initially cynical (particularly at the thought of having to replace most of our the pans), however, we have been using it for the last couple of weeks and I wouldn’t hesitate in whole-heartedly recommending induction hobs as the way forward. Where to begin with the advantages? The speed and versatility of gas without the hassle of having a gas supply and all the fiddly cleaning around a gas hob. This smooth surface induction hob can be wiped clean in seconds without any nonsense. I particularly love the speed that it heats up on the power setting. It is a fast as boiling a kettle. It is amazing how responsive the controls are! . The ‘pause’ tick over mode is particularly handy if poaching eggs as you can reach the boil on ‘power’ setting then maintain a low amount of heat using the ‘pause’ function. The display is discrete, neatly laid out and simple to use. If you have an AEG extractor fan it can even communicate with that to work in parallel, matching the extractor fan speed with the intensity of the cooking. This hob also has a built in timer so I don’t need to use the one from the oven. Our new set of pans have been put to good use! 5 stars!",Approved

"I was selected by AEG to receive the product free of charge in return for my honest review.

I found there was a lot to the steam oven, a lot more features than what I am used to; I worked my way through the functions and I love it! It is really great to have one appliance that can do so much. The steam function has to be the feature that stands out for me. I was slightly dubious of the benefits before I tried it. I have never cooked with steam prior to this and I find that the food just tastes better. I am not the world’s best cook so when cooking certain foods, like roast chicken, if I don’t get my timings right it ends up being a little overcooked and dry. Cooking with steam stops this from happening. I fill the water to the top most of the time, however if it is running low the oven will bleep. At the end of the cook, you do have to drain the unused water which can be easily forgotten – I’ll be honest I did a few times, but soon got the hang of it.

It isn’t the end of the world if you don’t use the steam function, it just reverts back to being a normal oven but you soon notice the difference and will remember to use it next time.

The oven is well designed, big inside, has an attractive digital display and importantly, very easy to keep clean. I would definitely recommend it.",Approved

"Recommended by Which? magazine as a Best Buy, and we can see why. The temperature is very consistent, but a bit cool in the main compartment.

It uses very little energy, in fact does not run a lot of the time. When it does , the motor is quiet and unobtrusive. My calculation is that it has already reduced our electricity cost for two people in a one-bedroom flat by over a THIRD! Yes, we had an old, inefficient but much smaller fridge and the savings are astounding!

Shelves are fine, the crisper/veg compartments are huge. I would like some stronger plastic for the construction though. Same with the freezer compartments, but with careful handling they should be fine.

Controls are easy to use. I am a bit puzzled about the fast freeze switch; are you really supposed to plan 24 hours in advance to put food in the freezer, as it says in the instructions? Also, there does seem to be some droplets of condensation which freeze at the back of the fridge compartment, I do not know if this is normal.

"I own the predecessor to this appliance (the Zanussi ZRB32313WA)

I initially bought this fridge, back in September 2013, because of the limited width my kitchen has available.
At 59.5cm wide, it really does ‘just’ fit into the space. (A 60cm wide fridge would be scratched if forced into the space.)

When I first started to search for a fridge-freezer, I was concerned that I would be limited to a few options, of basic machine with awful specifications and possibly cheap quality.
During my search, I found the Zanussi range offered this perfect width, but was also a high-spec’ machine (with a high energy rating of A+) but was also generous with internal space. It wasn’t cheap either at £419.99 I was buying something better than average.

I found that various sellers actually sell this same machine under variations of the same model number – the differences between each ‘version’ was as simple as the graphics stuck on the drawers, or how many plastic shelves are supplied for the fridge compartment.

The machine was bought locally from a Euronics store and was specially ordered in. It was delivered a few days later. It fitted perfectly into that 59.5cm space I had for it.
Perfect. When it use it made those ‘common’ fridge-freezer sounds, like bussing and the occasional crack. (At first these were alarming but there was a guide with the instructions that cleverly demonstrate the various noises the machine will make.)

I found the internal space fantastic for my needs:
For the fridge, a couple of bottles of wine in the rack, plenty of door shelving for my fruit juice, dairy items, and the two drawers fine for my vegetables. The rest of the trays held various other things like jams and chutneys.
For the freezer, the three drawers were great for storing meat and stock. For a single person, I could easily store a month’s work of meat and frozen veg.

Then after 7 months of use, in April 2014, the machine stopped working. I went away to a relatives on Friday night and returned on the Sunday to find the machine silent.
I opened the fridge to find it warm, and smelly – food was rotting. I opened the freezer to find it barely cold, and the meat had thawed out. All that food had to be thrown out. I wasn’t happy. I contacted the seller, who passed me onto Zanussi.
The machine has a 12-month warranty, and so an engineer came out a couple of days later. He repaired the machine within about an hour, and essentially ‘re-gassed’ the appliance. A few hours later it was all back up and running, and I could get about re-stocking it with food. All was fine.

It turned one year old in September 2014, and so the warranty expired.

At the end of November 2014, at 14 months old, I returned from a couple of nights away. It was Sunday afternoon and I returned to find machine has stopped working again. This is 7 month after the initial repair. I wasn’t happy, and also very aware that the warranty had expired.
As with the first failure, the machine was silent. Once again, the fridge was warm (warmer than the actual kitchen) and stinky. And once again, the freezer was full of thawed meat, and warm, too. And once again I threw away a lot of spoiled food.

I contacted Zanussi on the Monday morning. During that day, I made three phone-calls (each lasting around 30 minutes). I explained the problem, and was advised that an out-of-warranty service would be £115. I refused to pay this given the age of the machine, and the fact it had already failed once before. I asked to speak to someone about a replacement machine, and was advised I’d be called back. This happened for the first two phone-calls – as nobody returned my call.
The third call was pretty much the same, expect this time it was 5.15pm and most of the office had left for the day. I was given the Customer Care email address and advised to write in.

So, that Monday evening I emailed the Zanussi/Electrolux Customer Care department and explained exactly what had happened. I also sent this email to my local Euronics store as well as the main Euronics customer service email.

A week has no passed, and it’s early December (writing this review on 6th December).
In that time I have not had any response from Zanussi, nothing from Euronics, and one call from my local Euronics store that have supposedly contacted Zanussi themselves. I even contacted Zanussi UK via Facebook and Twitter, who have simply passed my contact details to the Customer care team.

Having spent over £400 on an appliance, I would expect it to last well beyond 14 months. (My previous fridge-freezer was a Hotpoint, cost £400, and lasted me 3 years before I sold it with my flat to the new owner.)
I appreciate that machines do fail, and that is why we have warranty periods, but the value of the product also implies its quality. This machine hasn’t lived up to its retail value.
Also, given the age of the appliance, the customer should not be willing to pay out £115 to repair a fault that has occurred twice. In both cases I’ve been forced to throw away food that was never reimbursed, so why should I keep losing money for a faulty product?

The appalling level of customer service is simply unprofessional. I find it infuriating that customers can be treated this way – if I treated customers in this manner, I would be fired with immediate effect.

So, given my rant, do I recommend this machine? No.
Would I look at buying anything from Zanussi again? No.

Stay away from this product, and possibly any fridge-freezer produced by Zanussi, unless you really like throwing money away and receiving the worst possible customer experience.",Rejected

This fridge has had 3 doors and 2 handles so far in the 1st year. The doors go rusty down curved edges and the handles split and fall off. Now to cap it all there is a rust patch on the side too.

"I received AEG BP5014321M in return for an honest frank to the point review , i was delighted to get chosen and am even more so now i have been using it , What cant it do , would be an easier review to write , as for every function so far has been an easy process with fantastic results ,
this single oven has 9 cooking functions, This oven range is designed with an extra large cooking space, which is over 30% bigger than standard oven,making it easier for the larger family or special get together's where your cooking for more people
The steam function is great I have used this function a couple of times on each occasion the food has be beautifully crisp on the outside, and moist on the inside. I was weary at first as I had never used anything like this but its been great.
The timer is a great thing to have as i can go out leave the food in the oven and set the timer , it will come on when programmed and go off at the right time , ,
The oven will go off soon as the door is open and back on soon as it shuts so it have a great safety feature which i like a lot ,
One thing i have never had in an oven before now is the defrost and thaw ,i have been able to defrost food quickly and safely when i have forgotten to remove it from the freezer the night before .
One of my favorite functions has to be the pyrolytic technology .
The pyrolytic cleaning programme heats the oven to such a high temperature that it will reduce excess grease and food residue to ash. Once this is complete and the oven is cool again you can simply wipe the ash away with a damp cloth.This function is best to be set and used over night when you do not need to use it as it does take a while, ok my oven was fairly new with hardly anything to clean , but i couldn't wait to try it out , iv had self cleaning ovens in the past that never seemed to self clean , so even with what little grease there was i saw the difference, I mean who enjoys cleaning their oven I am overjoyed that's now a thing of the past ,
so over all i would definitely recommend this oven specially if you have a large family or even if you just love cooking and baking ,",Approved

"Had this cooker for a couple of weeks and loving how quickly it does everything.  The large knobs make it easy to control the hob and ovens.

It’s the first time I have had an induction hob and I really like how quick and controllable it is to heat the pans, and if I take a pan off the hob it switches the zone off.  The boost button really gets a pan of water boiling fast.

The bottom oven heats up much faster than my old gas oven and I’ve learnt because its fan assisted I can reduce the heat by about 20 degrees when following recipes.  It’s big – the depth easily takes my pizza tray and it comes with 3 shelves so I can get loads in.  The heat is fairly even over the shelves.  Both oven doors are triple glazed and stay cool, so I’m not worried about by my kids looking at what’s cooking.  The top oven has a nice 2 zone grill so I don’t have to heat up the whole grill just to do a couple of items for the kid’s tea.

Overall because it’s quick and easy to use, it’s giving me more confidence with what I cook for my family.",Approved

I bought this machine for the large capacity so that i can wash my duvets however i have not tried to wash them as yet. But there appears to be a couple of design faults so far... Machine boasts of a 30 degree wash but fails to mention that the spin speed defaults to 800 rpm and you cannot change it. The clothes are far too wet for the tumble drier so i always have to let the wash complete and then re-spin at 1200. Who would want a main wash to end on 800 rpm? The other fault is the conditioner draw retains a fair amount of water when prog has finished which will create mould its a shame about both these problems and i hope Zanussi will create a fix .,Approved
"Washer works well including drying very much better than our previous Zanussi (which had given very good service for 10 busy years). It has all the programmes we need and more, but could be a little quicker on the standard programmes (however, it has a Quick button which we are beginning to use). It can swallow quilts and give them a good freshening, something our previous model could not. Our model does not have the stop-leak feature found on more expensive models, which is something Zanussi could with benefit incorporate in their next version of this model.",Approved
"This is our first induction hob and it seems we made an excellent choice!

Works great. Electrical instructions could be clearer as it’s set up for 400v,Approved
I was concerned that the cycle seemed a lot longer than the old machine but it measures the weight and adjusts accordingly. Dries well and clothes seem less creased. The only minor issue is that the on of button is too sensitive. Great overall,Approved

"This is the tardis of dishwashers, I can get so much more in this one.",Approved
This has to be the longest washing machine I have ever owned. Its says it has a quick wash option which only reduces the rinse time. Its has an 8KG drum. but the wash times in the manual give you times for only putting 3-5 KG of clothes in them. What does this mean well it means that you can double or even treble the time they quote !! I did a normal load of clothes which took 2 1/2 hours. Which means if I want to wash three lots of bedding in one day I am looking at nearly 9 hours !!. The quick wash programme only washes at 30 degree so that not much use either. I would avoid this machine like the plauge ! when I buy a machine All I want is a large drum a quick wash option/ time shorting option and a spin of 1200 plus. I thouht I had this with this machine but sadly NO -,Approved

I had to pause the machine at midnight and continue the next day until I realised the ECO programme was this long. The instruction book is very misleading as the ""Programme chart"" is almost impossible to compare with the ""Consumption values"" which show the programme times, then to make it worse there are 3 programmes out of 11 that you can actually put 8 kg of washing in - but again there is nothing to tell you the weight limit for the Easy Iron, Refresh, Duvets, Jeans programmes!

"I no longer own this machine. I now have a Zanussi Jetsystem ZWH7122J which is 100 times better.

I purchased this Zanussi Flexi Dose model in 2011 thinking it was a quality product from Electroloux Group, I was initially ok with the product but not overly pleased. The drum is pretty small and not a genuine 6kg sized one, to fit in a 6kg load, one would need to squeeze the washing in there. The detergent drawer is tiny and only has compartment for detergent and fabric conditioner, its so small!! The machine seems to be very, very sensitive to the slightest unbalanced loads and it struggles to spin a heavy load. I used to have wait up to 20 minutes sometimes for it to spin, it would start, stop start, stop trying to spin, this was very frustrating - knowing the machine could have just spun like say, the Jetsystem machine I have now. The Flexi Dose machines are clearly not as well built like how Zanussi machines used to be which is why they are so sensitive to spinning loads - I would never touch another Flexi Dose model again.

I would also like to mention that I wrote a letter to customer service manager at Zanussi and I never received a response. Because I know how good the Jetsystem models are, I went out and purchased one of those, but I have to say, the customer service at Zanussi-Electrolux leaves a lot to be desired. I had to sell this machine on because it was just too frustrating to use.",Rejected

"After a shaky start, the nice men at AEG replaced the faulty oven and refunded the additional fitting costs, the new oven has been up and running for about 6 weeks. The controls, although a little intimidating are easy to get to grips with and both ovens are efficient with plenty of capacity in both. Two small niggles really, the slats in the shelves could be a tad closer together to stop loaf tins rolling and the timer is too fiddly to set, mainly because the first 5 minutes counts up in 10 second intervals and then the timer runs away with you, I went out and bought an old fashioned ringer timer. The induction hob is super efficient and the best bit is, it is so easy to keep clean, I have never needed anything but a damp and dry cloth to clean the hob as food simply does not burn on. After a lot of use it looks as good as the day I bought it.",Approved
"Disclosure: I was selected by the manufacturer to receive this product free of charge in return for an honest, impartial review.

I don't know where to start with describing how much I love this fantastic oven! It was really straightforward to install and fitted perfectly to replace my old electric oven. The stainless steel door looks fantastic and the controls are simple and straight forward to use but it is the functionality that has really blown me away. Steam cooking was fairly new to me but I am definitely converted as it is the perfect way to create succulent flavoursome meat and tasty fish as well as delicious bakery items such as bread, crumbles and pies. It is really straightforward to fill the reservoir with normal tap water and there is a gauge to tell you when you need to refill. As well as the steam function are a fan setting and a conventional oven settings if you prefer. The oven heats up really quickly and switches off when you open the door so saves energy wastage which I really like.

In addition to the usual cooking and grill functions there is an element at the bottom of the oven providing all round cooking for pizzas and baking – so no more soggy bottoms!

Another feature I love is when you start cooking the clock changes to show you how long you have been cooking for. When cooking for a busy family this is really useful as it is easy to lose track of time! There is also, of course, a timer function that can be set and even a delay timer so you can get everything ready in the morning and have it switch on and cooked in time for a really tasty dinner.

As well as all the cooking and baking functions is a self cleaning functionality which blitzes all the grease and grime in one go. AEG really have thought of everything even the A rated energy rating! I would recommend (and have recommended) this oven wholeheartedly to anyone looking for a great quality oven with amazing uses.",Approved

"This is an excellent  cooker.  

The ovens and hobs  all heat up very quickly indeed, particularly the main oven which gets to 200 degrees in less than 10 minutes. They are very easy to clean. The knobs on the front are very easy to grip even with my arthickity hands. The triple glazed doors mean that the outside of the oven doors stay cool enough to touch even when the oven is at a high temperature. The only slight downside is that the timer display is difficult to clean as bits become stuck in the edges and it's difficult to clean between the buttons.

The metal shelf supports are easy to remove for cleaning and make inserting the shelves and the grill pan much more manageable.  The slight lip on the shelves is a good idea as it stops dishes from accidentally sliding off.

The grill again heats up very quickly and cooks food evenly.  It is also quite easy to clean. The fact that the grill pan doubles as a roasting dish and trivet is also a good idea.

Overall I would heartily recommend this cooker.",Approved

It is strange that it has a 30 minute cycle, and the very long cycle (poss around/above 2 hours), yet no choice of a middle cycle of 45 - 60 min cycle. thankfully I have another machine I use as well, and so am not held up by the speed of this one as much as I would be if it was my only washing machine.",Approved

My friends and fed–up listening to me go on about yet another great feature of this oven, or yet another thing I have cooked in the oven which has turned out perfectly and above all succulently!

I had never cooked in a steam oven before and so was not prepared for the huge benefits this has. The operative word has to be SUCCULENT. Everything I have cooked on the steam setting has been more juicy and succulent than anything I have cooked in an oven before. But steam is just one of the feature of this amazing oven.

You can choose between fan oven setting, pizza setting, defrost, steam, grill, top and bottom heat and many more options, helping you to achieve perfect results whatever you are cooking. The electronic food probe is fantastic. You insert it into the middle of a joint of meat, set the core temperature and the oven will automatically switch off once the desired temperature is reached, taking the guesswork out of cooking and producing perfect results every time. I like 60 degrees for a perfect roast beef. And once you have finished cooking, you select the Pyroluxe function and the oven will burn off any grease and fat leaving only a small amount of dust at the bottom of the oven to wipe away for a perfectly clean oven. AMAZING!",Approved
"I purchased this machine in Sept 2012 and have been very happy with it. I had an AEG from 2002 to 2011, so wanted to stay with the brand.

I sold that one and purchased the Zanussi Jetsystem ZWH7122J which is far more superior to the Flexi Dose models. Just a bit disappointed that Zanussi never replied to my letter that I addressed to the manager regarding the Flexi Dose model.

The Jetsystem, ZWH7122J washes briliantly, is not too noisy in use and rinses the clothes properly. The only gripe I have is the motor screams when it spins. Really glad I purchased this machine and love the Jetsystem feature which seems to help saturate the load properly. The machine takes around 2 hours 15 minutes to wash on cottons 40degrees and 2.30 on Cottons 60 degrees. The machine has some unnecessary programmes, but that appears to be machines of today from all manufacturers. This machine is very well made and is stable on spin with no vibration. Highly recommened.",Approved

"I am really pleased to have been asked to test and review this oven.  It replaces an older AEG model which had less digital functions

The first thing I noticed is that when I set the oven on timer, the clock does not disappear. So you can view the timer and the clock, this was not possible on the previous model.

There are so many functions to try, but one of the functions I really like is the heat from the bottom, when making a pizza.  

The turbo grilling function is also very good, and I followed the manual's advice for a cote de bouef I cooked at Christmas, which turned out perfectly.  

Another great asset to this oven, is the fact that the door doesn't get hot, and I can safely let my grandson touch it, when the oven is on and not worry about him burning himself.

For the first time I used the drying function, to dry some some orange slices for Christmas decorations, and again I couldn't fault the oven
 

I also love the pyrolytic cleaning, it's a great asset, as I really don't like dirty  ovens.

"The oven has many good cooking functions and features although I mainly cook using the fan oven.

A simple thing I like is the alarm when it reaches the required temperature. My previous oven did not have this and I was always forgetting to check if the temperature was reached. 

On the down side, it takes a long time to heat up, especially as it is so small. When using the fan oven it takes 8mins 40sec to reach 160c and over 10 mins to reach 180c. When heating croissants that take 3 mins to cook this can be very frustrating. My much larger AEG single oven takes 8mins to reach 170c!",Approved
"I am so pleased with our new AEG BPE742320M Mastery range oven. It looks very smart and doesn’t show fingerprints which is nice. There is a fast heat up function which really quickly brings the oven up to temperature. I like the fact that it is really easy and intuitive to set the timer so the oven switches off at a certain time or after a set number of minutes/hours. I cook a lot and I used to have to get the manual out every time to work out the timer with my old oven. There are loads of clever functions such as keep warm, the favourites setting and moist fan heat. The defrost setting worked brilliantly with some frozen chicken I had that I needed to carefully defrost the other day. It feels really safe to use with child lock and cool touch glass on oven door. I love the probe cooking meat exactly right. I am going to use it with a beef joint later. The best bit though is the self- clean function!!! That is worth its weight in gold and the oven looks immaculate still. All in all I am really thrilled with this oven. Oh, I nearly forgot to mention the pull-out rails! The rails are fab, why oh why has it taken me this long to find an oven with this simple yet superb feature.",Approved
"I wasn’t going to buy this oven initially but a combination of price reductions made it a no brainier. My opinion may be biased by the fact that this oven replaces one that was at least ten years old. Heat up is an order of magnitude quicker than my previous oven and yet I suspect that the power drawn is but a fraction of my old oven. Cooking times are much reduced, again reducing overall power consumption. I can honestly say I’m looking forward to my next fuel bill. 

The one dial, menu system of programming is very straightforward. Goodness knows whether I will ever get to use half of the features and programmes available. I’m sure this oven would cope with the requirements of the most professional chef whilst at the same time helping out us novices. I’m only just getting to grips with the oven, hence the lack of a five star rating. So far, so very good.",Approved
"The dial is well designed and very easy to use, the chunky design makes it very easy to grip and turn to your setting. There's a 5 shirts setting that is just brilliant, just 20min....with the quick mix coming in on 30min. Spin speeds range from 7 - 14000 with temp from cold - 90%, another good feature is that the machine gives out 3 bleeps letting you know the wash is ready for its next cycle or completely finished. Another good feature is the water fills up through the top of the drum, mixing washing & powder brilliantly. What is also fantastic, the filter is actually inside the drum, so easy to take out check and clean, no more kneeling on the floor and waste water running across the floor.
And with the name of Zanusi you know your buying a product that is well manufactured wth quality workman ship and built to last.
You will not be disappointed.",Approved
"found metal wire in machine several times and ruined cloths, will never be buying anything again from this ridiculous company who are telling me different story every time as to why they cant replace washing machine, only few months what complete joke and waste of money, machine in shed waiting to go for scrap.",Rejected
This product has all the features you will require in a single oven and in steam oven mode is great for baking and roasting leaving cakes golden brown on the outside and moist inside. The oven reaches set temperatures quickly and all fan noise is kept to a minimum. The quality feel and overall design with a large cooking space also add to the ovens appeal. The only slight drawback is the small mode symbols on the oven mode Knob which are rather small and could be difficult to see if your eyesight is poor.,Approved
"We're really happy with the oven, it does everything that is should do perfectly; it looks good, heats up quickly and accurately and has all the functions that we wanted (and probably more). We do a lot of bread baking and the results are absolutely fantanstic. 
A couple of very minor quibbles (and they are minor, we stress that we are really, really pleased with the oven) - firstly the lip on the wre shelves makes it difficult to get heavier items out of the oven without the shelf sliding forward; putting the fuction symbols on the dial rather than on the fascia looks good, but makes it difficult to read. Also the layout of the instruction booklet is eccentric to say the least, but you'll get there in the end!",Approved
Product was easy to install went straight into 13 amp socket latest models require 16amp meant whole kitchen electrics would need to be renewed. The oven performs well just getting used cooking time very good product.,Approved
"Having always bought the top of the range in the past, I was completely surprised by the reliability and operation of the machine. Like the fact I can set it for a short wash, and can also have an additional spin. Altogether very pleased.",Approved
"Compared with the previous oven this is near silent. It is easy to set function and temperature, and seems to heat very evenly throughout the oven space (also unlike the previous, inherited, CDA oven). Good light once you remove the grill tray. Spacious - two shelves as standard. Bit disappointed by the ""steam function"" (a dimple in the base of the oven cavity - hi-tech, not). Yet to try the pyro oven cleaning which is not as highly rated as others by Which? Also too soon to assess the power consumption. Overall, moderately happy!",Approved
It has only been a short while since I bought this item but loved every minute of using it,Approved
"Brilliant model altho perhaps too many options, if thats possible?",Approved

"Have really enjoyed using the oven and discovering all the many features it has, including bread proving. I love the way it lets you know the oven temperature after it has been turned off, when it's cooling down. Everything I've cooked so far has turned out great.",Approved
"Have been using this for c. 3 weeks and am thrilled with it. Instructions are clear and easy, and the quality of the cooking is way better than our last (very) old electric oven. It's quiet when on, heats quickly and it's very clear to see the cooking process through the glass door. Also easy to clean with the recommended bowl of hot water and lemon, and a simple wipe down. I haven't yet used the steam or pyrolitic functions so can't comment on that but otherwise recommend giving this serious consideration if it's the type of oven within your price range.",Approved
"This oven is great quality, fantastic features and internal space Ive made some great bread and profiteroles with the steam bake feature, only slight negative is that the manual isn't very clear learning more by trial and error.",Approved
"Very modern looking, easy to set up and use, fits in well with existing appliances.",Approved
"this new washing machine replaced one that was quite old.
the quality of cleaning is so much better we wished we had changed it years ago!
however the biggest improvement is how quiet it is, the washing machine is in our kitchen where we also have a breakfast room, and you can now sit and talk or watch TV without any disturbance even when it is on the spin cycle.
Only downside is that the wash cycles take quite a bit longer than our previous machine.",Approved
This oven has all the features that I required in a oven. The meat thermometer works perfectly and gives brilliant results every time. The steam bake makes your food moist especially bread and cakes. I would recommend this oven to anyone.,Approved

"In short, you must prepare yourself for reading a manual to carry out the most basic functions. I am not a cook or chef but my wife asked me to put on the chips at 19:15 (manually).
Seems simple enough but luckily I found the manual and hey ho I think program 9 will do . Why should I need to look for instructions? Perhaps what is missing is a training course provided in the sale - which in our case was via a DIY chain.
If you are interested in this unit, you must learn what a ""program"" and what a ""function"" is.
All to difficult for me - would love to meet the Designers.
I feel much the same about the AEG Microwave we bought with the kitchen.",Approved
"I had to find the solution to getting the oven off demo mode, and I have not yet received my cookbook",Approved
"I bought this machine on 31 July this year when my old one (Hoover) gave up. I researched on the internet and this does all I want. I only use the 30 minute programme (700 spin only option), only 2 of us retired, followed by 17 minute spin at 1600. My previous machine had a 37 minute programme including 1600 spin which is what I really wanted again so this one does require me to be aware when the wash has ended and reset for spin cycle. But there is a digital display of how long left and it pings several times when finished. However, being at home all day, not a problem and I turn it off after 5 or 10 minutes of the spin depending on the contents, quite sufficient for most things but use full 17 minute spin for towels and jeans. Filter in the drum brilliant idea. Old machine involved water on the floor when emptying. All round so far so good and very pleased.",Approved
"I am using this machine since about 4 month already and I like it. The spinning is 1600 rpm and it helps to me to dry our clothes faster, I recommend for people who doesn`t have a dryer machine. I use the timer and the quick wash option often, very useful when I am out of time. The Cotton ECO cotton program is 3h 48 mins on 60 degree, 2h 52 mins on 40 degree. The quick wash program is 1h 18mins on 60 degree, 1h 11 mins on 40 degree. I like the rinse hold too, I just put the washing in on the morning, set the timer and press the rinse hold, which helps me to keep the clothes fresh even if I don`t get home on time when the washing finished. It turns the clothes, not just leaves them in the water.
Temperature and spinning speed is variable for your own choice.
Overall I recommend it, can`t write a negative point yet :D",Approved

"This replaced our previous AEG pyrolytic oven which we were very happy with. This surpasses that product. Many of the functions are the same but this has the added benefit of steam cooking. Our Sunday roast is indeed a treat with crisp, succulent and tasty joints now on offer. It also comes with a food sensor facility but I have not yet tried this though I intend to soon.

The controls are very straightforward, easy to use and an improvement over our previous model. Everything is controlled by a dial. The fast heating up function does what it says.

In the short period we have been using this oven, we have not had the time to use all of the preset functions but those we have used, work perfectly.

The pyrolytic cleaning function is a blessing on its own. This makes oven cleaning a simple procedure and not as in years gone by, a dreaded chore.

All in all, this is a great product in the Mastery range and I highly recommend this.",Approved

Have heard nothing. Tried to google help but could find very little. A lot of money to use one basic function - true fan cooking - which works well. I would expect that function to be good on any new oven. I have never written a review before but feel so strongly with this that I felt I had to. Very dissatisfied with a very expensive oven.",Approved
"Steam cooking,temperature probe both add a whole new dimension to my cooking choices, and if I make a mess,I don't have to worry about cleaning because the oven does that too.",Approved
Lovely design in the main though egg tray too small and very flimsy. Excellent large salad tray at bottom. Very quiet running and good value for money but would have like 4 trays instead of 3 in freezer.,Approved
Really happy with this product as has plenty of programs for what you need and the facility to alter the spin speed at your discretion. I hope it lasts.,Approved
"So far the oven has been great. It cooks evenly and the temperature control is impressive. I am pleased with all the functions used so far. Care has to be taken with placing the probe in a joint of meat. The sensor is accurate but if too close to the surface it will not be an accurate measure of the meat at the centre. The probe is accurate. AS the man said who passed a window having fallen off a skyscraper. ""So far so good"" Seriously a really excellent oven.",Approved
"While having been initially excited by the 10kg wash load, it soon turned into a nightmare, that made me wish of not ever having bought this washing machine.
We've had an AEG fridge freezer for years and have got an AEG tumble dryer - both with no problems, so thought after having read numerous reviews about this washing machine, that it be a good product and AEG in general being a good company - unfortunately I had to be proofing wrong.
Within days of it arriving and us washing with it, our clothes were having an odd smell to them, which meant me contacting retailer John Lewis , where it was purchased, who said an engineer would need to come out to check it. As he checked it, he couldn't find any physical fault, however didn't know what would cause the fault. Even doing a suggested 95 degree wash meant a couple of washes later the smell was back....we were using the same washing ingredients as with our old machine, however AEG been telling us, that the smell is caused by what we are putting into it. This is totally ridiculous, as we haven't changed anything and haven't had any of this smell issues with our old washing machine. This has resulted, as we just couldn't stand the smell on the clothes any longer, of plumbing our old washing machine back in - with which we don't have any issues of smell, using exactly the same things. Only to be told, of us needing to continue to use the AEG, which apparently John Lewis technical department have been told by AEG HQ. This is extremely distressing by now and very disappointing and taking a lot of energy and time to sort out with waiting in for phone calls, which end up being a waste of time and physically having to go into the John Lewis store several times with little success so far. 
This machine - only used for a few days, is sitting ready to be picked up, even though apparently AEG are refusing to pick it up, as saying there is nothing wrong with it....well, I had to stop washing my clothes with it, as the smell was so bad and it is very distressing them not believing me.
I haven't got a clue, what is causing the smell, all I know, that it is there when using this AEG and not with my old washing machine, I haven't had this with any other washing machine before either.

Apart from the smell, we found, that cotton washing are taking a ridiculous 4 and half hours....the finish sound won't turn off [ even engineer didn't manage].....wash cycle begins with a drain....suggested end time incorrect [ it was saying towards the end that it had 10 min to finish, however it was taking over 20 min to finish causing me to miss an appointment as waited for machine to finish]....wash and spin is much noisier than my old washing machine....clothes are stuck to sides at end of wash, unlike our old washing machine, which has got a few gentle drum moves to loosen it off]....end of wash peep lasts past the time, that even when the washing is taken out...

All in all this washing machine is a nightmare as is AEG customer service.
I certainly would NOT recommend it to anyone, as wouldn't like anyone else to go through, what we have had to go through over the past few days/weeks.

Nor is this washing machine meeting UK trading standards conditions, as it is not suitable for the purpose it was bought for.",Rejected

"Bought this to replace a two year old Bosch which had lost it's Turbo function. Firstly, I went to AO.com where they offered price matching. The vacuum was £250 every where I looked except for John Lewis which was £199.99. But AO also offer a £50 trade in, and they collected the old vacuum on delivery of the AEG. So a new vacuum cleaner for £150, so I was very happy.

I liked the Bosch but it was a faff to clean the filter, easy to remove but it had a foam type filter that just clogged up and beating it to clean just covered me in fine dust. The AEG has less capacity but emptying it is a doddle.

The AEG is considerably lighter to use than the Bosch, not that either are difficult but the AEG is just so much more manoeuvrable. It's every bit as powerful and lasts just as long before the battery dies, but it has a light as well which is useful.

The biggest difference is the demountable hand held facility the Bosch didn't have. Vacuuming stairs is now dead easy, as are little DIY jobs.

Overall, performance of the two is around the same, the AEG edging it slightly as it seems better at room edges but the emptying and demountable facilities are a distinct advantage.",Rejected

Bought this in a sale as old machine had broken down and I’m pleased. Not as many ‘features ‘ as the old model but they were not really needed. Some of the shorter programmes do not allow for a fast spin but it’s easy to re-spin at 1400. The long guarantee was a plus but hopefully it won’t be needed.,Approved
"After testing alternatives in store I found this cleaner was light and easy to use. The motor was toward the lower end and not up towards the handle as some battery driven cleaners are. I purchased it for my wife who is disabled but she finds it perfectly easy to handle. It also doubles as a hand held unit but I,m not sure how effective this aspect is. The capacity of the dust collecting unit is on the small side but as it is easy to empty this is no drawback. It has a 180 day swivel action rotating brush unit and is good at picking up dirt from carpets. It has an 18v lithium battery which is constantly charged from a docking station.",Approved

"Bought it mainly for the detachable hand vacuum and didn't expect much from the floor hoover part.
Hand part is a bit disappointing. Good output but the short nozzle pickup is sited under and back of the unit
and masks your view and is not very effective. Need a long nozzle and possibly a small brush attachment.
Could be supplied in the box but the accessory pack is an expensive extra.

However the floor hoover excells. Very light and manouverable, lights are brilliant and it is quite powerful.
You can do the whole ground floor in a flash and reduces the need for a long drawn out session with the big hoover. Its surprising what gets picked up. Needs regular emptying. Much better than expected.

Overall a useful addition. It wont replace the big hoover but is saving a lot of effort by providing a quick and effortless freshen up service.",Approved

"We're enjoying using our new AEG cordless vac. It's proving to be very useful. We keep it upstairs and use it for cleaning our bedrooms and landing, which are all carpeted. It's a very effective cleaner which belies its appearance and weight. We use a Dyson V6 cordless downstairs so have been able to compare it. 
The Dyson is far more powerful sounding, but doesn't seem to pick up dirt any better, which seems quite odd. The AEG certainly sounds much less powerful, at least in standard use, but it cleans really well. This suggests the AEG must be very well designed indeed. 
The small stairs attachment for the AEG, however, is very powerful sounding and works exceptionally well. Also, 2-in-1 design of the AEG allows it to convert instantly into a useful hand held vacuum to allow edges to be cleaned. 
In comparison with our Dyson, the AEG is easier to use. The Dyson has much of its weight in the hand, whereas the AEG is beautifully balanced with hardly any weight in the hand at all, meaning the and wrist has a far easier time of it. This makes the AEG truly excellent if you suffer with any kind of wrist problems or arthritis – it is lightweight, very manoeuvrable and certainly powerful enough for everyday cleaning. All-in-all, and taking into account the price and design especially, the AEG has not in any way disappointed.",Approved

This freezer is appox 50% bigger than our previous freezer which we have had for more than 10 years. This allows us to keep more of the food in its original cardboard packaging as it fits in perfectly.,Approved
"Although a little on the noisy side, this is an excellent, extremely lightweight, vacuum cleaner, and as other reviewers have noted, it really shifts the dust. We bought our first one a year ago and have now purchased another to keep upstairs. Saves lifting one up and downstairs, although it is so light this isn't really a problem. At around £60 it is also very good value for money.",Rejected

Why can’t the fitting instructions booklet actually provide instructions. There are poorly drawn step by step pictures that are not at all clear and some of the dimensions shown were not accurate. By saving money producing just one booklet for the entire global market has resulted in a useless guide. I am a competent dIY er and was simply replacing old for new but after fitting this item I will not be buying another AEG item that requires fitting instructions. Product itself seems okay so far,Approved
"This freezer is quiet and works efficiently up to now with no problems. One major criticism, however, is the fitting instructions which consist of nothing more than a set of pictures with no written instructions. It was easy enough to install the freezer in the space under the worktop, but unless you are reasonably good at DIY you may have a difficult time fitting the cupboard door to the freezer door.

Well built and quality as expected from AEG. Draws are easily accesable and of good size. The display panel warning lights behind the door panel being visable on floor level is an excellent innovation giving immediate notice of any pending failures.,Approved
"We have a large house, a mixture of hard floors and carpets, plus two large dogs. So quite a challenge for any vacuum cleaner. I've always favoured the Dyson Animal uprights as the best cleaners and the only ones up to the job. The latest DC41 is very good, but it is heavy and very hard work to push around. So much so that my partner is unable to use it. And as she likes to share the household chores, we needed to find something more suited to her needs.

I've always been a little sceptical that a lightweight, rechargeable cleaner could be up to the job, but how wrong I was! The key features of this cleaner are its weight and its maneuverability, and it scores very highly in both areas. It is light enough to carry around without great effort, including up the stairs, and is easy to push and control. Cleaning is excellent, and so much better than I expected. Every bit as good as the Dyson, for so much less effort.

The cleaner comes with several very useful features. The main cleaner element is removable, so you also have a ""dust buster"" facility. This includes a head with rotating brushes and I've found this excellent on the stairs and upholstery. The main head has a very innovative cleaning function, so a press of the foot activates a cutter which removes any hair or larger items caught-up in the brushes. There are also a line of very useful LEDs at the front, which illuminate your progress.

The cleaner comes with a charging stand and instructions are to leave it on charge when not in use. It is simple to drop it into position and LEDs indicate the charging level. I can clean the whole of our house on a single charge.

The only negative is the size of the waste receptacle. It is small, and requires fairly frequent emptying. But then the size is a major feature of the product, so this is a necessary consequence.

All in all, I'm very impressed and pleasantly surprised. I would not have expected a cleaner of this type could be so effective. I would add that I think this cleaner would be particularly suited to someone elderly or with mobility problems who finds conventional vacuums hard work.",Approved

"Had this machine but in the 10kg version for a month now and absolutely love it!
Excellent washing results even at low temperatures
The Time Saver function literally gives you a full cotton cycle with max spin in just over an hour giving perfect results
It is easy to use exceptionally quiet even on max spin
Worth every penny
The large 10kg drum fits a king size duvet no problem 
Whether you wash a small or large load, the Pro-Sense sensors really do adjust the cycle times, and water great if your on a water meter.
I’m so impressed with this machine from AEG, I would like the matching dryer. 
If the dryer is as good as the machine then it will be money well spent 
IDE better get saving!",Approved
A 9kg load machine seemed attractive but it turns out anything but cotton has a 3kg maximum. This limitation  isn't made clear in the sales publicity The 15 year old AEG machine this replaced had a smaller maximum capacity but could do a synthetics/mixed fabrics programme with a full load. The old machine got clothes drier at 900rpm than this does at at 1400.,Approved
"We are a family of two. In my old machine with a smaller drum, I had the washing machine on nearly every day, now, because the AEG has such a large drum, I only need to put a full load in around 2-3 times a week. Love the fact that, if I haven’t got a full load, the machine senses that and will adjust the time accordingly. Also, has a quick wash of 30 mins, and that washes great too.",Approved
"Freezers should all do the same job - keep food frozen. And it does that. But at a cost. The machine is far noisier than I anticipated, and in an open plan house it's the worst. The drawers are fine but why aren't there shelves instead? You can fit a lot more onto shelves than in drawers.",Approved
"I’m very happy with my choice. It has all features a household needs at a very good price. The control display is very user friendly. I love the option for reducing the cycle time, which is available for most programs. The best feature for me is the short program - 20 min, up to 3 kg. I had to use it 3 times last week and it saved me so much time and energy. It’s perfect for a one-time worn clothes with no stains. I’ll use that a lot in the summer. Overall a great choice!",Approved
"This a realy great products which need one family,i hope in future company AEG made quality and great designers products.Good luck from me and my family",Approved
"Our new AEG washing machine is very good and fast machine and cloths always come out clean but what is outstanding how quite it is compared to all our previous machines, sometimes you think it stopped mid cycle, that how quite it is",Approved
"I will never buy an AEG product again, nothing but trouble from the start, this has had so many problems in the first few months of having it, the filter has broken about 4 or 5 times now if I recall, the hose that connects the brush to the vacuum to put the debris into the collector has broken (it has torn the plastic of the hose), and as I can't do anything about it any more, I have had to settle for putting masking tape round it, to stop the dust blowing straight out of it again through the broken hose making it airborne, creating more dirt than there was before we started to hoover.

We got it originally for the ability to step on the part that lowers a blade to the roller, that 'cut' any hair or threads that get tangled on the brush, but to be honest we never really saw the need to use it, unlike with mains powered ones.

There is a massive risk of this falling over if you wanted to stand it up, as it is top heavy, and even if it is locked into it's upright position, if you have floorboards they will wobble the floor under it and it loses it's balance, so you have to lay it flat, or leant against something solid to steady it, so you have to be so careful when pausing to move a rug or something, so you have to be aware of this all the time, but ours will be binned soon as we don't need the hassle.",Approved

"We replaced our previous AEG ""Competance"" double oven with AEG Competance Double Oven - Model DC401302M.
However, after the first use it was clearly apparent that the End of timer ""Beep""/Audible annunciator ws barely discernable above the general background kitchen noise. eg: Hob extractor, pressure cooker or radio and certainly cannot be heard from adjacent rooms.
Our previous oven had an adjustable 3 level tone and at its highest level was audible throughout the house, even with kitchen doors closed.
Having sought advice from our supplier, we are advised that there is no adjustment on any of the current AEG ovens, so we are stuck with a useless oven timer and now need to purchase a decent stand alone kitchen timer. Clearly this is a design oversight. Perhaps this range of ovens should be rebranded as ""In-competance"" to reflect the design team !!!",Rejected

"Looks great when you first install it. Stylish in looks, however the black gas rings discoloured when used once, as did the inner silver inserts under the rings. The metal pan holders are a nightmare to clean and looked stained and old after a couple of uses. Pans do not sit on the front two gas rings properly so only small pans can be used on these. No good if cooking a Sunday roast for six. The red electric display lights intermittently stay on when the gas buttons have been turned off making it look like the hob is still on. Sometimes they turn off sometimes they remain lit for up to 40 minutes after the hob has been switched off.

Telescopic rail is fantastic.

Negatives so far.

Was cooking steaks on the Turbo grill and 3mins in the oven went into a cut out all lights failed then it started up again after around a minute, customer service were not aware if the oven had a thermal cut out but if it did it shouldn't have came back on.

This double oven has some great features for various cooking such as baking. Cooks food evenly and is really easy to clean! We love our new oven and wouldn't hesitate to recommend.

"excellent oven, cooks very nicely, grill slow to heat up but cooks quickly when it is hot, and lovely to have self cleaning panels on most surfaces. Only marked down at all because as other reviewers have mentioned the oven function and temperature indicators are on the knobs instead of the face of the cooker, I have to stand on a step stool to get high enough to see the controls properly.

It features a very quiet wash cycle that cleans and spins with greater efficiency than anything I’ve seen before.

The features available are impressive with a great choice of combinations for every type of material that you will need to wash.

"My old AEG 66600 which I have owned for 9 years has finally given up & I did not see a need to get it repaired.
I looked around for a new AEG washing machine, as the last 3 have given excellent service.
My new machine came today, & it looks very modern, it is already on it's second wash load.
I like the fact that it is A+++ & it does not appear to take on as much water as my old machine, which is a bonus being on a water meter.
I hope that it gives me good service as the last 3, I did look at other manufacturers machines, but chose to go with AEG for the quality.
I've had to put ownership as a week, as it was the lesser option.",Approved
"Like most people I have bought all new equipment for my newly fitted kitchen. All AEG this oven was part of it.

This is a great oven but a couple of things need improving:
1) The oven takes a while to get to temperature. Not sure if this is as its new! Also maybe just my previous cooker was very quick.
2) The symbols around the dials are impossible to read (especially if you have slightly poorer eyesight!).

Other than that a very good cooker.",Approved
"This was a replacement cooker for our AEG Competence cooker and whilst the look is similar some features are lacking notably the audible warning when the oven temperature is reached, also the timer is not as loud to hear as the previous one. The main problem is the temperature readings being on the sides of the pop out knobs as described by other reviewers, maybe AEG could produce a stick on guide that could go over the knobs as my wife finds it very difficult to set.
Overall the cooker efficient.",Approved

Love the fact that the bottom tray can be raised and the top level cutlery tray. Nice quiet machine,Approved
I have an earlier version of this hob. It looks great and functions well but within 6 months the markings on it will begin to wear off and they will be virtually gone within a year. This makes it very difficult to operate with accuracy and very dangerous. Unacceptable especially given the cost of the hob.,Rejected
"Purchased to replace my 15 year old AEG Competence oven that had served well, but was showing signs of wear. Well packaged, but I was disappointed how dusty & dirty the oven was under the packaging, and after cleaning I found a chip in the enamel on the floor of the top oven. The replacement was also so dusty & dirty from the factory. The instruction manual was more like a book of cryptic clues so it took a while working out the features. For example, the turbo grill feature was also called the fast grill or forced fan grill depending on what part of the book you were reading. A separate leaflet was included for 'clarification of the operation of the grill element in the main and secondary ovens'. For the economy grill in the secondary oven it states that only the inner element will be in operation, and yet the outer element will glow brighter than the inner! I am not sure if any of this is relevant to my oven anyway as I do not seem to be able to set it to economy and the graphics shown do not exist on my oven. I cannot get the feature to work that enables the display to be turned off, and have contacted AEG regarding this. AEG's response has been polite and helpful, but I am awaiting clarification as I am told the place of manufacture has to be contacted. All of this is such a shame as once I worked out how to use the oven, I have had nothing but perfect results. As with its predecessor, I love the bottom heat feature that gives pizzas a beautifully crispy crust. The grill toasts evenly, and a tray of sponge cakes also cooked very evenly. Well worth persevering, but I do hope the instruction book is rewritten to make more sense.",Approved

It looks stunning!
It was easy to fit (did it myself) and is so much better than the old double oven we had.
It works beautifully... We're using the smaller top oven more than we had imagined. 
We like the lights in BOTH ovens. 
The bottom heat function is wonderful for bread and pizzas.
The controls are easy to use and we love the push in function on the knobs.
We had a single -under the counter - AEG oven at a previous house and are so pleased to be back with AEG again.
The build quality is superb!
What else to say? Looking forward to many years service with this, just as we had with our other AEG!",Approved
An easy to use very smart looking product. Like the added feature of showing remaining heat in oven after use. Would highly recommend.,Approved

"After having a Neff double oven for nearly 20 years I was apprehensive about changing to another make. I need not have worried. This double oven is everything I could have asked for.

The oven has great features and is really user friendly. Easy to clean (I use oven pride once every 3 months). The glass panels are a little tricky to remove but in no way difficult.

The only negative at the start was the lack of grill pan handle although it would have to be two handles to click on due to the large size of the grill. Being part of the oven though you quickly get used to using your oven gloves and it means one less thing lying around the kitchen.",Approved

"Its a nice oven, what can i say it dose the job.

My concerns aren't with its performance but with the build quality. For me this isn't quite what i was expecting from AEG. It doesn't feel cheap, but its defiantly not a quality well mad product.

To give but a few examples, the aluminium surrounds at the top of the oven feel thin and have not been attached well, they look like they are lifting at an angle due to how think the aluminium is.

When you open the door the glass on the inside of the door is attached, firmly i might add, on 3 sides of the door, however, at the bottom there isn't anything just a long large gap that with a bit of force would allow me to pull off the glass. When placing items on this section it doesn't feel as though its the firmest of surfaces. This doesn't effect the door or how it looks but i am concerned as to how i'm going to clean up in there as it will get dirty and spoil the glass. In my opinion this would have been better if it was all sealed in and then i wouldn't have to worry. 

Next issue is that the beeper on the timer its is very very quit. I've searched the manuals and online and all suggestions of how i turn the volume up just don't work. Again doesn't effect the performance of the appliance but makes the timer a useless feature if you cant hear it.",Approved

"Bought this AEG oven to replace a 15 year old oven from another brand. The main deciding factors were the all black colour scheme and the price.

There are only 2 small negative points. Firstly, the timer bleeper is not very loud and can only just be heard from another room. The other issue is with the temperature/function labels on the control knobs - the writing/symbols is on the edge of the knob itself and I can only just read the symbols as they are lined up with a marker above the knob - wouldn't be a problem in a below counter installation, but you need to be very tall (or use a step stool) to be able to read them when the oven is installed at eye level.

Other than these minor annoyances, we're quite happy with our new purchase.",Approved
The only issue with this oven is that when fitted in a tall unit that a shorter person can struggle to read the dials for temperature etc other than this I was very pleased with this product,Approved
Would have got 5 stars but it is very difficult to see the icons around the knows. I'm tall and I struggle so anyone small would need a stool. Also I've never had a grill that you have to keep the door closed so that's taking a bit of getting used to.,Approved
Fitted in well and easy to operate and works very well. Only downside is difficult to clean the smudges left during installation.,Approved

"I've only had this machine installed for a week and I've run a range of loads already as our old one (Electrolux# broke down after 6 years. Hope this one lasts longer, it has a free 2 year manufacturer guarantee - a fact I wasn't aware of until after I purchased.

I bought online from Kingdom Appliances who were helpful and informative and even phoned back to confirm the time slot.

It just missed out on a Which Best Buy - #Indesit and Bosch were top# but the build quality of this machine looks much better than the Indesit. The buttons have words not silly symbols and the buttons are firm, like the Bosch but at £200 less, it's an obvious choice. The wash got a Which A rating and spin B, with C overall as the drying cycle isn't so efficient, but I don't dry much anyway. A critical consideration for a washer in kichen/diner area is NOISE. Most washing cycles are about the same, but the spin #1200 rpm# was about 6dB less than other machines. I know that doesn't sound much, unless you know that dB #decibels# are a logarithmic scale - hence every 3dB increase means it's TWICE AS LOUD. This unit really is QUIET...

I know many like Bosch #I do too, but it's an old design, as is the Indesit# and the annoying thing about the Bosch is the loud beep at the end. This AEG does it too, but you can turn it off!

Good German design and made in Italy, #not China) so better for the environment and Italy have been a prime manufacturing base for washers for over 20 years.

Only minuses I can see are - due to the large drum the filter is situated under the kick board at the bottom of the unit, so you have to take the board off to clean it and the new ""anti-overflow"" water pipe is a bit short and we only just got it to fit.",Approved

"Overall a great extractor fan - useful features, like the different speeds and ability to push a button and it runs for an hour then switches off - to cook then leave the kitchen and it come back nice and fresh having switched itself off automatically. The lowest fan speed is nice and quiet, ideal for gentle simmering and talking. It also has the hob to hood - but my hob isn't enabled for this so not able to test. 
Twin lights are nice and bright, very useful when cooking and the chimney/height is very adjustable as I mounted it quite high as I am 6ft and wanted to see all four rings. I installed the hood myself - just two items; the bracket to attach the chimney to wall is right at the top - not great if your ceiling to wall is not exactly square (or you have coving) or to get it right up to the ceiling. Secondly all the fittings are torx head screws and while the fitting guide, included torx converter and drill template are excellent, trying to tighten the lower two screws is a challenge with larger hands! Don't let that put you off - overall a great unit and would definitely buy again.",Approved

The design is great, looks beautiful, and the features such as the stay warm and the alert when it’s finished boiling are very handy.
Overall I would highly recommend the kettle. I have no regrets at all and would purchase one again.",Approved
"The washer dryer has been a great product to trial out. I have typically been use to washing my clothes and then drying them on the AGA. I have been impressed by the freshness of the clothing and laundry after washing and drying.
I was also impressed with the eco settings available on the machine. I very often do at least 2 washes per day - kids! - and whilst the temperatures were low the cleanliness of the laundry was very good. A top tip of using a liquid detergent was useful to know.
! found the machine easy to use, in fact it was very intuitive and as I am not great with instruction booklets - this was a real bonus.
The machine was quiet and unobtrusive and this was important as I do so much washing that I am pleased that the noise was minimal.
It has also been great to have the extra space now that my old tumble dryer is not needed. It frees up space in my utility.",Approved

"I had this induction hob installed a couple of weeks ago now, having previously had an electric hob, and before that gas. Firstly the heating performance is miles better than my electric hob, and easily matches my experience with gas. The boost mode means boiling water is really fast as well.

Where this hob really wins out though is ease of cleaning. With the completely flat surface and very low risk of burning on food all it needs is a quick wipe down after cooking, and no pesky knobs or rings to have to clean around (which especially annoyed me with gas).

The ability to set individual timers on each section is also really helpful, although the alarm could be a little louder. The residual heat indicators are also very handy.

I've not had a need to use the pause functionality yet, but could definitely see it being good for answering the door, etc.",Approved
Bought this to replace earlier model which was trouble free for over ten years. Unfortunately the baskets have been REDESIGNED BUT not IMPROVED. This has resulted in bodged attachments to allow the spray arms to operate without hitting other components.,Approved
"We’ve had this about 6 months now 
Called in the repair agent as fan was hitting back plate from new
Repair agent who came out said what did you have before my wife said a rangemaster he said you should have got another as these are not as good 

He did a repair but did not last 
As we called them back again
he brought parts 
This repair did not last as you can still here the fan blade catching the back panel as the oven heats up and cools down 

So I should call them back again I’ve had a few aeg products and found them good on the whole perhaps just been unlucky",Rejected
"The racks do not hold plates or glasses upright so less pots are washed in one go, hence dishwasher on more often than previous Hotpoint one. Old one was brilliant and working well 15 years on from purchase. This Aeg Dishwasher was purchased within kitchen from B & Q and was fitted in Aug 13. B&q really need to know about poor quality of product as the rest of their kitchen was very good. Also, wheels are not sturdy or strong enough to roll rack in and out when full - the rack has to be lifted, causing a possible back injury due to the weight and positioning of body when loading machine - my husband often has to 'lift' rack in for me. Also, pans and baking trays now have to be washed by hand as they do not fit in or stand upright due to poor strength of plastic that the racks are made of. I would not purchase an AEG product again.",Rejected

I previously submitted a review saying how disappointed I was with this dishwasher & now having used it for 8 months my opinion hasn't changed. I have been trying to contact AEG for 4 weeks because the salt light won't go out on the dishwasher even if I refill the container but AEG are not interested in talking to their customers. If you phone them you get a recorded message saying your call is being transferred to a local repair company but clearly they don't monitor the local repair companies as the one they are trying to transfer me to either don't answer their phone or are engaged. I have emailed AEG four times and written to them. They haven't even had the courtesy to acknowledge my letter and I still have a very unsatisfactory product.,Rejected
Very difficult to load efficiently. Wash cycle settings are very limited with only three and a rinse to choose from. The delay start timer can only be set for a set period of three hours only. I was probably spoilt by my previous B***h dishwasher. However this is the one which is integrated into the kitchen units. Would not have purchased by choice.,Rejected
"Good:
- washes dishes better than other dishwashers I had

Bad:
- VERY NOISY!!
- Baskets are poorly designed. Wires too thin. Basket parts (wires) non-foldable. Impossible to wash wine glasses. Impossible to lower/raise the top basket with dished on (it is very complicated operation in comparison to other brands like BOSCH). Lid for cutlery basket that should separate cutlery has too small holes, so it is possible to fit the cutlery that have very small / think handles.
- broke after 10 months.",Approved
"The induction hob fitted in well over our oven and  looks sleek, simple and cool. It didn’t take that long to master how to use it with a simple swiping technique to turn the heat up and down quickly using a slide control- felt like I was using a giant iPad! First thing I tried was boiling some water - which didn’t seem to take very long at all. 
When I heated some soup I could do this really quickly and then move it directly onto another hob to simmer. When it started bubbling it would immediately stop as soon as I swiped the heat down. Cleaning really quick also. 
I did find that the hob was sensitive to things being placed on top - there was a spillage and it automatically turned off which is good yet I felt it needed some sort of sound to alert us that it was no longer on. 
Another draw-back seemed to be the fact that not all our pots and pans were compatible with the new hob meaning I can’t use some of my favourite cookware on it and new purchases would have to be made. 
However- a great product overall!",Approved
"We fitted this a customers request, instructions so basic, but rating suggested a normal 13amp out, so we popped a spur box with said fuse. 5 sec's into use, fuse blew (tried 4 times - checking wires etc - usual stuff). Phones Zanussi and after 25 min wait gets tech support.... oh it needs a 15 AMP FUSE ..... this thing only exists in mini circuit breaker and distribution board formats ... so unless you are a qualified sparky who can run a wire back to the board or protection device, the unit is useless",Rejected
"The user interface for operating this microwave is horrendous. It takes so many button presses just to start the microwave on a setting other than ""luke warm"" it's a joke. The default power level does virtually nothing. It's incredibly hard to clean because of the exposed grill element. There is a high pitched whine when in stand-by - such as after opening the door and not cancelling the remaining time. It has a fan that runs for a period of time when cooling down after running - which is very noisy.",Approved

"This appliance manages to be much smaller inside than anticipated for a 12 place dishwasher. The upper rack is particularly poorly designed in that it is impossible to stack anything but the smallest glasses and crockery, resulting in half the space being almost unusable.

The default timer on the microwave is 4 minutes at 600 w. To get it to 1 minute at 1000w you have to fiddle around and press endless buttons. So you end up leaving it and everything burns...in one place as the heat is not evenly distributed without a turntable. Also it is (stupidly) located on top of my oven and the door opens from the top down so I can’t reach in without a ladder! Even with a ladder I can’t reach the back to clean off all the exploding porridge. DON’T BUY THIS,Approved

It took me a long time to choose this model after detailed research of getting the right features. With two boys under 4 the family needed something that had a large load capacity and was energy efficient because the machine would be put through its paces from day one.

"This machine has a lot to live up to; our previous AEG machine worked almost every day of its 15 year life without a problem; indeed it was still going when we decided to retire it, as we felt that it wasn't washing quite as well as it ought to. We are still to be entirely convinced by this new machine. It does seem to wash very well, and it is unbelievably quiet; however, we have not managed to get a 'spin and drain' programme to work yet, and having looked into it further, we have found many reviews saying that this function is so finely programmed that unless the load is balanced exactly right, it will not work. We have also noticed that during other programmes, the timer will remain fixed at a certain time for anything up to 15 minutes, before moving on. For example, the first time we used it, it remained on 8 minutes for ages, before then just finishing the programme. However, as I say, it does seem to wash well enough, but I would be happier to give a proper review after a couple of years. At the moment, I cannot rate it any better than 'average', because we have not yet got full confidence in it. Perhaps we need more time to get used to the differences from our previous machine. But if it does half as well as our previous AEG machine, it will have done very well, and from our experience over the years with various other appliances, I am always happy to recommend AEG.",Approved

"I was rather anxious to replace my trusty oven of 11 years with the new Zanussi. After all, my culinary reputation was at stake! It was easy to replace but the real test was always going to be performance. I was having friends over for Sunday lunch but decided to make my Ottoleghi roast chicken with clementines, fennel and arak the day before…you know, just in case. Just short of an hour later I was looking at how the humble chicken turned into a perfect dish of golden brown lavishness. The fan distributed the heat perfectly across every ingredient. I finished it with just a few minutes under the grill that heated up in a no time at all. 

Next up was my signature pavlova. It’s a delicate dessert and takes 75 minutes to bake. I like to make two and then stack both layers to make an impressive and decadent presence on the table so it is important that my oven can take two large plates at the same time and bake both with the equal perfection…and it did!  I understand this is due to its multiplus function, something to do with the heat distribution technology. For me it simply means that my pavlova looks like identical twins ☺. 

I have my new Zanussi now for just under a month and I have not found a single red flag. It’s a ideal for my city kitchen, it is quiet and simple to use. By that I mean it’s not overly complicated with countless unnecessary buttons, gages and electronic paraphernalia I don’t understand. It is beautiful, functional and stylish. I am most impressed with its programme function, something my old oven didn’t have. I can prep my dish, go and play tennis and set it up to cook my slow roast duck or lamb shank to be ready just in time for Strictly! Oh, and just as you think it cannot get any better, I can remove the glass doors for easy cleaning. Very pleased indeed and excellent value for money.",Approved
"Having had our last top of the range AEG dishwasher for 10 years and been really pleased we decided to do a direct replacement, Unfortunately the design has been changed and if you put anything in remotely wet then water leaks out from the bottom of the door all over floor. Called AEG who advised this was because the inside had increased in size and I should put items in dry I find this a remarkable design flaw and struggle to comprehend it. The door on the unit is remarkably thin metal and the slightest knock with cutlery puts a dent in it. Disappointed with the quality and design but cleans the items well and is quite quiet.",Approved

"I've owned this dishwasher for over 1 month now and I'm very pleased with it. This dishwasher looks great in the kitchen (I ordered the white version or you can get the stainless steel colour). I love the interior light, which helps to see inside when loading or unloading or cleaning the filters etc.

It cleans well and is VERY quiet; at first I had to check it was actually switched on and working, as it's so quiet during the washes and rinses! If you are looking for a quiet dishwasher, this is DEFINITELY the one to buy. Drying is fine and even plastic items dry better compared to my old dishwasher (I have put the rinse aid setting on number 3).

Can't fault this dishwasher, but if I'm being picky, the only 2 minor issues are: the instruction booklet could be better translated and the extra options for the programmes have to be set every single time. If, like me, you use the options ""Extra hygiene"" and sometimes ""ProBoost"" (for the 70 Pro cycle), you have to remember to set these options before starting the programme.

I have a few tips to help any future/current owners:
if you use hard detergent tablets, avoid the ""Auto"" programme and the other short ones - I only use ""50 Eco"" and ""70 Pro"". The short programmes (including ""Auto"") won't fully dissolve hard tablets, leaving white bits on everything and bits of food, or just use soft tablets like Fairy Platinum instead.
The cutlery basket has to stay in the bottom-right. If you move the cutlery basket, the items of cutlery won't get washed properly. Finally, don't put any large items directly below the detergent dispenser i.e. no large items (except plates) covering the bottom-left corner of the bottom basket, otherwise hard tablets won't fall into the water and may stick to whatever is in the way.

Overall it's a great dishwasher that cleans everything properly, is quiet and worth buying.",Approved
"I am extremely pleased with this machine, I find it to be efficient and it offers lots of options which suit my needs really well. I am happy to recommend it to other people.",Approved
This is a well specified dishwasher but in less than a year we have had problems with leakage (stopped working with error messages) and now the door hinges are squeaking badly,Approved
Great for small kitchen.so helps me not having to wash up as i have motability problems .saves time can put on a 30 minute wash great .and a long wash for pans ect. .and the door opens when its finished.steam.greature bursting out great fea,Approved
"Just a couple of niggles I'm afraid, with this beautiful machine. The clear plastic display cover for the LED display has come loose and slipped, making the display itself open to the elements in the kitchen.Also the plastic spray arm on the top rack has a broken tab so it is currently cable tied in position. NOT what I would have wanted from AEG. Help is being sought on these two minor issues. Other than that, the machine works quietly, effectively, and has proved reliable so far.",Approved
"bought this oven after my ode faithful gave up.So pleased I did,it cooks my food beautiful.so easy to clean,very impressed.

"Our last AEG dishwasher had a screen with actual words on it, not daft symbols that light up or don't. It was also considerably quieter than this one. 
It's OK, but I'm not as impressed as we were with the six year old one that it replaced. On the other hand, it's not leaking, so that's good.",Approved
"We had not had an AEG appliance before and decided that we would try one as we believed that these were a cut above the other brands; Unfortunately the machine is quite flimsy and light, the bottom rack keeps coming off its runners the door is hard to open when empty without pulling the machine out from under the kitchen unit. The interior panel of the door has dented by a pan handle and the display on the programme panel has started to craze. It uses a lot of salt and rinse aid despite being set according to the instructions. So far it washes the pots ok, but no better than the previous cheaper brands we have owned. In conclusion it was a lot of money for what it is",Approved
"We are very pleased with our new AEG dishwasher, it gets things really clean first time which was not always the case with another manufactures dishwasher we last had. It is very quiet in operation and controls very logical. Our only complaint is that you need two hands to open it, one to hold the dishwasher still while you pull the door open with the other. Don’t know how anyone with only the use of one hand would cope.",Approved

"After careful investigation and deep research, we decide to buy this dishwasher.  Advertising was amazing, also as pictures. The reality was is not what you expect from the machine from the top class.  Quality of baskets is same as midrange class. The door is floppy and feels like hinges are broken. But the seal is tight so no real issue with this. The display is informative and responsive.  But you can't choose option or programme with a single button. You need sequence pressing until you reach what you need. Again not a big issue, but we are talking about the top of the range model, it should have the proper menu selector. There no CHILD LOCK, this is bad. Quality of wash is superior, dishes and pans are washed clean with no residue or any leftovers in it.  With full load machine done amazing, every single corner was reached and cleaned.  But 30 min program is designed only for light grease and only ""fresh"" dirt (wash your dishes straight after you ate your food). ECO programme is same as auto, with a difference in drying. It dries your dishes naturally, by an opening door. and no any heat or vent inside.  Finally, one of most important parts of the review. Machine stopped working within the first week of use (about 5-7 loads). After a phone call to service (outsource)  been told I need to wait a week for an engineer,  And again after 3 days of waiting Engineer told me that there will be a delay for another week until someone comes over to assess the NEW faulty item. So I believe it may take up to 4-5 weeks until it will be fixed ( there always need order parts).",Approved
Very impressed with this hob. So nice to use and instruction book straightforward to follow. It’s quick and heats well. Settings are so easy to use when cooking.

"Overall this is a great dishwasher. It has good space and looks very stylish. The machine is also very quiet, washes everything for us exceptionally and uses hardly any salt (although dependent on your location). There are a few things that could be better including the display which you have to cycle through and can be over sensitive at times. This means that the machine can start inadvertently before you have selected the correct cycle. The other issue is that the machine weight is very light so you need to wedge the appliance into the space otherwise it will move all over the place as you have to pull hard to open the door. Other than these small issues we are pleased with our purchase and have been using it happily for the past months.",Approved

Highly recommend this dishwasher",Approved

Very pleased with product, washes well and the spin cycle is very good",Approved
The cooker looked OK in the shop and I thought being Zanussi it would be good. Mine had crooked knobs so that had to be corrected after delivery. The grill doesn't have a temperature dial so it has to be on full all the time and the only way you can control it is to move the shelves up and down. Doing cheese on toast you end up with burnt edges and not cooked in the middle due to the shape of the element. The grill pan is too big to go in my sink but I've kept the one from my old cooker. The grill pan has rough edges too. There are no castors so won't be easy to clean behind. Other than that it seems to be OK.,Approved

"We have always had Bosch dishwashers but thought this time try AEG, as we rinse off before putting in the dishwasher and 80% of our cycles are the 30 minute cycle we were looking for dishwasher that had this also higher brand than other makes. So far very pleased with product the only thing we find is the drying cycle, our last dishwasher did not open the door supposedly to assist drying so especially the cups/mugs dried okay our AEG we find on the 30 minutes cycle we need to hand dry cups/mugs we have not done a long cycle so it might dry differently. Overall well built dishwasher and very quite.",Approved
"All of my appliances are AEG as I am generally very happy with them but bought this particular dishwasher as I was on a limited budget and I am quite surprised how well it works. Other reviewers have said that it leaves glasses smeary but I use the recommended cleaning products and my glasses come out sparkling every time. I am also quite surprised how well it does clean in general and have only had a couple of occasions where a food deposit is too stubborn to be removed and in general everything I have washed is cleaner than it has ever been. The only down side is that the trays are a bit flimsy and a great deal of care is needed in stacking to get everything in, but it works and I am happy. Lastly the instructions could have been clearer, it was actually easier to install than trying to understand the instructions.",Approved
"brilliant dishwasher and a great price, really like the 30 minute cycle and still a very hot wash",Approved
"We had our new zanussi oven fitted with ease and were keen to try it out as our old oven had been a bit temperamental and unreliable of late!

I put in a home made pasta bake and a supermarket bought quiche and found that both cooked pretty thoroughly and evenly. 
After that my son did some cup cakes which also came out well! 
Next day I did cheese on toast on the grill - this seemed fairly even but not quite as impressive as the oven as had to move the bread around a little. 
Best bit for me is I am usually the one that’s cleaning the oven ! You can remove the glass doors and do them in the sink which is cool! 

On the whole a great replacement to our old oven - seemed to be much quieter with a nice black and sleek design.",Approved

"First of all it is a simple modern design which fits in perfectly with our modern kitchen. The controls are also easy to use with a few extras that we haven't had before. The knobs feel sturdy and move with a positive click. 

Not only does the smaller top oven have a grill but you can also heat the top and bottom of that oven separately. We used the top heating element along with the grill and it browned things super quick. 

The main fan oven comes with 3 shelves which helps flexibility when cooking a number of items. What I did notice is that the fan oven has much quicker cooker times than my previous oven. Things mostly cook to the lower recommended time in the instruction booklet.

The clock is bright and easy to use and has the added function of having an auto switch off function which I have used when I am particular busy when cooking, saves things being burned. The lights in the oven are also very bright and makes keeping an eye on your food easy.

The defrost function is also nice to have and works well if a little slower than our microwave. Good to have though, as a back up and for larger items.

Overall I would recommend this oven",Approved

"This AEG is perfect.I chose it based on size, water usage and the efficiency rating. I only had limited space and this model was exactly what I was looking for. The inside is lovely shiny stainless steel. The top shelf holds large mugs, cups, glasses, kitchen utensils and small and side plates. The shelf moves with ease on the runners. The bottom shelf will hold 13 large and 13 side and small plates. It has also been very cleverly designed as you can fold flat one of the plate racks to accommodate pans and casserole dishes. The cutlery tray can fit in either of 2 places depending on how you want to use the space, between your plates or at the front of the basket. It depends on how many pans/dishes I have that need washing. I have been using the 60/70 degree wash programme which has performed very well. My slow cooker and casserole dishes have been washed first time without having to pre-soak them.The dishwasher is very quiet and the door opens on the last minute to aid the drying process. We are now a family of 2 and it often takes 3 days to fill the dishwasher. I am really pleased with my purchase and have not been disappointed.",Approved
"We purchased a new AEG dishwasher to replace our old one, we bought the new version which doesn’t seem as robust as the older model. The door is stiff to open and close due to the design feature of the door automatically opening at the end of the cycle to aid drying. The top shelf has a plate rack in the middle which doesn’t fit plates properly and would be better without it. The cutlery holder doesn’t sit well in the bottom, the old one was curved to fit the tray better. On a good note though it does wash well which is it’s main purpose! We are generally happy with it, just a few niggles.",Approved

"I bought this dishwasher because the previous householder took theirs. It was fitted and works just right. It is well made and is big enough for most families. When I say I am sort of disappointed, I mean that it does not clean the dishes as well as my old Neff. Sometimes baked on deposits remain, even though the dish has been packed correctly. But generally it does its job. Couple of bizarre things though. The cutlery basket has a lid, but all the holes are the same size and it is generally pointless because you cant get much in it when its on the basket. So I have binned that. Also the machine door springs open at the end of the cycle, as an aid to drying the dishes. Two things here, one it's a bit odd a solution to drying the contents in my view. Secondly, it frightens you to death if you are close by, because it suddenly springs open. (It's not really frightening, but it is a bit of a sudden surprise)!!! Other than that it should do its work for years to come - hopefully. I don't regret buying it, but it has it's quirks,",Approved
Very disappointing purchase. Fridge lurches forward when opening - the handle has not been designed to overcome this. It is also very noisy when the fan(?) goes on - much more than the 39db quoted by the manufacturer. I can hear it upstairs! Would not recommend.,Approved
Machine performs very well however one point to note is that the bottom plate drawer is not very well balanced or robust. I find that when a few plates are loaded at the back of the drawer it unbalances the drawer to the point where it comes off the runners. The drawer seems a little lightweight,Approved

"I own the predecessor to this appliance (the Zanussi ZRB32313WA)

I initially bought this fridge, back in September 2013, because of the limited width my kitchen has available.
At 59.5cm wide, it really does ‘just’ fit into the space. (A 60cm wide fridge would be scratched if forced into the space.)

When I first started to search for a fridge-freezer, I was concerned that I would be limited to a few options, of basic machine with awful specifications and possibly cheap quality.
During my search, I found the Zanussi range offered this perfect width, but was also a high-spec’ machine (with a high energy rating of A+) but was also generous with internal space. It wasn’t cheap either at £419.99 I was buying something better than average.

I found that various sellers actually sell this same machine under variations of the same model number – the differences between each ‘version’ was as simple as the graphics stuck on the drawers, or how many plastic shelves are supplied for the fridge compartment.

The machine was bought locally from a Euronics store and was specially ordered in. It was delivered a few days later. It fitted perfectly into that 59.5cm space I had for it.
Perfect. When it use it made those ‘common’ fridge-freezer sounds, like bussing and the occasional crack. (At first these were alarming but there was a guide with the instructions that cleverly demonstrate the various noises the machine will make.)

I found the internal space fantastic for my needs:
For the fridge, a couple of bottles of wine in the rack, plenty of door shelving for my fruit juice, dairy items, and the two drawers fine for my vegetables. The rest of the trays held various other things like jams and chutneys.
For the freezer, the three drawers were great for storing meat and stock. For a single person, I could easily store a month’s work of meat and frozen veg.

Then after 7 months of use, in April 2014, the machine stopped working. I went away to a relatives on Friday night and returned on the Sunday to find the machine silent.
I opened the fridge to find it warm, and smelly – food was rotting. I opened the freezer to find it barely cold, and the meat had thawed out. All that food had to be thrown out. I wasn’t happy. I contacted the seller, who passed me onto Zanussi.
The machine has a 12-month warranty, and so an engineer came out a couple of days later. He repaired the machine within about an hour, and essentially ‘re-gassed’ the appliance. A few hours later it was all back up and running, and I could get about re-stocking it with food. All was fine.

It turned one year old in September 2014, and so the warranty expired.

At the end of November 2014, at 14 months old, I returned from a couple of nights away. It was Sunday afternoon and I returned to find machine has stopped working again. This is 7 month after the initial repair. I wasn’t happy, and also very aware that the warranty had expired.
As with the first failure, the machine was silent. Once again, the fridge was warm (warmer than the actual kitchen) and stinky. And once again, the freezer was full of thawed meat, and warm, too. And once again I threw away a lot of spoiled food.

I contacted Zanussi on the Monday morning. During that day, I made three phone-calls (each lasting around 30 minutes). I explained the problem, and was advised that an out-of-warranty service would be £115. I refused to pay this given the age of the machine, and the fact it had already failed once before. I asked to speak to someone about a replacement machine, and was advised I’d be called back. This happened for the first two phone-calls – as nobody returned my call.
The third call was pretty much the same, expect this time it was 5.15pm and most of the office had left for the day. I was given the Customer Care email address and advised to write in.

So, that Monday evening I emailed the Zanussi/Electrolux Customer Care department and explained exactly what had happened. I also sent this email to my local Euronics store as well as the main Euronics customer service email.

A week has no passed, and it’s early December (writing this review on 6th December).
In that time I have not had any response from Zanussi, nothing from Euronics, and one call from my local Euronics store that have supposedly contacted Zanussi themselves. I even contacted Zanussi UK via Facebook and Twitter, who have simply passed my contact details to the Customer care team.

Having spent over £400 on an appliance, I would expect it to last well beyond 14 months. (My previous fridge-freezer was a Hotpoint, cost £400, and lasted me 3 years before I sold it with my flat to the new owner.)
I appreciate that machines do fail, and that is why we have warranty periods, but the value of the product also implies its quality. This machine hasn’t lived up to its retail value.
Also, given the age of the appliance, the customer should not be willing to pay out £115 to repair a fault that has occurred twice. In both cases I’ve been forced to throw away food that was never reimbursed, so why should I keep losing money for a faulty product?

The appalling level of customer service is simply unprofessional. I find it infuriating that customers can be treated this way – if I treated customers in this manner, I would be fired with immediate effect.

So, given my rant, do I recommend this machine? No.
Would I look at buying anything from Zanussi again? No.

Stay away from this product, and possibly any fridge-freezer produced by Zanussi, unless you really like throwing money away and receiving the worst possible customer experience.",Rejected

"I bought this product as I had an AEG dishwasher a few years and and I was happy with it.
This product has a lot of features and a large capacity. I particularly like the display on the floor. 
The main annoying bits are the cutlery tray has very narrow partition, so if your cutlery has any width it will not fit as shown in the user guide. I like the concept of the cutlery tray but the partitions should be at least 1.5 times wider then what they are. The other issue I have is that there is only space for 4 cereal bowls. Again all the partitions are too narrow and there is only one place you can put deep cereal bowls.",Approved
Much quieter & better than my old one & very well thought out,Approved
Had my new AEG dishwasher for a month now! It has all been fine so far and I like the economy wash cycle as it is money saving but washes everything fine. pans are harder to fit in the lower rack than in my previous dishwasher but Im sure I will get used to it. Door has to be fully open flat to enable the lower rack to be pushed back in.,Approved
"Our new AEG dishwasher is well made but the rack design isn't great. It lacks support for glasses on the top drawer and the contours of it don't seem suitable for cups or glasses. 
The manual seems to indicate plastic 'fingers' for glass support but we weren't supplied with these it seems.
The main (lower) drawer again isn't laid out well and is very prone to derailing and consequently jamming easily when being slid in and out.
We have just upgraded from a much lower-cost unbranded dishwasher, that frankly was much better laid out that this one, which is disappointing.",Approved

"Part of a number of AEG products bought for my new kitchen. 
The unit is quite flimsy until you get the door on. Even then it appears the door doesn't seem too sturdy and takes a little effort to align when closing. 
Not sure how you are supposed to see how long is left on the cycle and a digital readout on the top of the door would have been nice. I may have been spoilt with the previous free standing unit!
All in all it does a great job of washing your dishes (which is the priority at the end of the day!)",Approved
"We bought this based on capacity as many do not offer the freezer capacity we need. Plain, simple design which we like.

"This is my first ever dishwasher, and it’s fantastic! As long as you load it correctly (I’ve learnt by trial and error!) then everything comes out washed brilliantly and ready to put away. I love the fact that you can do a ‘quick’ wash or choose a programme to suit the plates, pans, etc. Even my Sunday roast dishes get put in - I don’t have to do anything. It’s great that I can load the machine and get back to guests when we have visitors, knowing that my dishes are being done while I sit and chat. And everyone loves the digital timer shining on my kitchen floor! I would recommend this machine 100%",Approved
"I've been using this super machine for a couple of months now. The range of programme options is excellent, although I've still not used them all. I tend to use the hour long OKOPower programme and the 20 minute wash the most. Some of the other wash options can last several hours, so I only run them occasionally - they're best used for heavily soiled items. Practically, most day to day loads would be fine using the OKOPower wash option. These days we all want to save money and help the environment. This machine perfectly tailors the water and power consumption to your load. The drum holds a lot more than my old machine did. So I'm running fewer loads which means I save time, power and water, and of course money too. Good news for me and for the environment. My only minor niggle. The 20 minute wash programme only offers a max 1200 spin speed. So if I want to remove extra water from the wash I have to turn to one of the other programmes after the 20 minute wash is finished and select the higher spin option from the new programme, that usually adds around 10 minutes to the cycle. I think AEG should add higher spin speed options to this shorter programme. But aside from that tiny point, I highly recommend this superb machine from AEG.",Approved
I like the versatility of this product - but wish I hadn't changed my old Bosch; as effective cleaning is my main priority. Poor cutlery cleaning - find I need to rinse mine before washing; Bosch had no such issues. Worst aspect is design of drawers; struggle to fit many dessert or deep plates - likewise cannot wash our tall glasses at same time as our dinner plates; even when adjusting drawer heights. My old Bosch was much more effective in its design; coping well with a variety of different glasses and dishes; and washing cutlery more effectively from the bottom holder.,Approved

"This washing machine has all the programmes I need. The short programme is just that and is perfect for those forgotten or just need freshening up. The OKO programme is great too and not too long. This model is not the quietest model that AEG make but it is fine for an enclosed kitchen but could be noisy in an openlan kitchen . 
I would thoroughly recommend this washing machine.",Approved
"Not happy with this machine. The user manual could have been clearer, it took a while to figure out which programme to use. Most of the programmes are very long - there's a ""quick"" button which is supposed to shorten the cycle but doesn't. Clothes come out horribly creased, things that didn't used to need ironing now do. If you have something that needs washing separately, do it by hand however bulky as the 30'@30 setting doesn't spin a small load effectively.",Approved

No doubt a clever machine but the interface is not intuitive and awkward to use. Some of the symbols used bear no meaningful relation to the activity they represent. You would have thought that with touch screen smart phones being old tech they would have used that to be more user friendly.

I am disappointed with this product. My dinner plates are normal size and I have to fit them in diagonally or they catch on the side of the machine when you push the drawer in. Important bad design fault.

"This washing machine is top notch, it looks really smart, is as quiet as a mouse and the ten kilo drum is heaven sent. We have never before had a washing machine that can handle a duvet, but this one can! The programme selection options are very intuitive and the delayed start option is incredibly easy to use. My only tiny criticism of this domestic wonder is that it lacks a display telling you either how long is left or where it is in the wash cycle.",Approved
"I wanted a straightforward washing machine that would cope with all the laundry my family generates which is why the 10kg feature appealed to me.  It’s easy to get the load in and out through the door – even bulky items like single duvet.
It’s got 8 programmes some of which have a quick option which is great at getting the job done fast when I’m in a hurry.  Setting the program is easy on the buttons though I do miss it not having a display showing the remaining wash time.  The wash results are good even at 30 degrees and the spin is really thorough – I used to have to do the spin twice on my old machine before hanging out the clothes to dry, but not anymore.  Even when it’s spinning at top speed it’s quiet so I can use it in the evening.
The machine does not have a prewash option, but it’s not something I used very much – I tend to put a spoon of Vanish in the washes that need a bit of extra cleaning power.
Overall I’m happy with the machine – it’s economical, quiet, washes fast and the build quality feels good.",Approved
"Just bought this model from John Lewis.  Very good, would have preferred pre-wash option. Like the 5 minutes time out after wash. Quick wash option better value than main wash, saves about 1/2 an hour. The 30 minutes at 30C wash good as well for refresh. No filter at bottom front as many years ago. Impressed!",Approved

"This is our very first dishwasher that my girlfriend and I have owned but we've used others in the past so we kinda knew what to look for. The thing that impressed us the most is without a doubt the Comfortlift system.
It makes loading and unloading the bottom drawer a lot easier and we absolutely love it. The weight of the items on the drawer has not been an issue and we've washed ceramic trays, pans, pots, etc...If anything I think that it works best when there's weight on it.

The cutlery tray is a bonus although it feels like it would take longer to empty and fill that a traditional cutlery basket. We still love it, because we can keep things organised and looking neat when they are in there.

The dishwasher is pretty quiet, it was really easy to install, even though we don't have the ideal setup in our current kitchen, and it's very easy to operate. The results that we get are really good although it has struggled with oiled ceramic trays but when I washed them by hand they were tough stains to remove so it's no wonder it struggled. Everything else has been coming out completely spotless.

The only thing that is slightly difficult to do is load the salt and clean the filters on the bottom and that is only because you can't remove the bottom tray. When you pull it out it's still there but at the level of the second tray.

We both absolutely love it and I think the only way that I could improve it is to put a projected time on the bottom instead of the simple red/green light that it has now. I've seen some other dishwashers that have that feature and it seems like a great idea to stop you from having to guess how long there's left in a cycle or to have to open the door to read the display.",Approved

"This product has it all, and is a flagship example of the quality German engineering AEG so proudly represents. The large capacity of the drum means I don't need to wash as frequently, and it's user-friendly, has a variety of fantastic programmes, is extremely energy efficient and aesthetically pleasing to boot. This washing machine definitely ticks all of the boxes for me, the Steam Function is a godsend and none of my woollens have shrunk... which I didn't believe possible until I saw it with my own eyes!",Approved
"Happy with the dishwasher, is much quieter than previous Hotpoint and has great flexibility with the shelf height and collapsible lower supports. 

Instructions to install were clear and came with everything required, including a nice template for mounting the finishing panel. 

Wished the timebeam could be in better focus on the hardwood floor, can look a little bit blurry (but nevertheless a very handy feature!)

Is excellent value compared to other manufacturer's models that I compared, would recommend to anyone that needs a compact, quiet, integrated dishwasher.",Approved

"In a recent kitchen refurbishment, it was suggested that I have a floor-standing fridge and the kitchen supplier duly supplied a CWA fridge - a good make which worked well. The only trouble is I really didn't like the design (it didn't have a salad drawer, only a recess into the bottom of the fridge which means that the bottom shelf is basically useless). Also of course you have to bend to get into the fridge. So I looked for and found the in-column eyelevel Zanussi and couldn't be more pleased with it. It packs a lot of storage space into a small fridge, it's efficient, and has a salad drawer. What it doesn't have are any egg trays which I find a bit odd.

good machine so far",Approved
this machine covers all requirements and would be churlish to look for faults any complaints against machine is failure of owner to persevere and study requirements,Rejected
"Given that our last washing machine was also an AEG and did sterling service for over 15 years, our new AEG has not disappointed - quiet, easy to use, great capacity and with a pretty comprehensive range of programmes and features. Calculating the time and water usage automatically based on the load size is very useful, as is the timesave facility. Very impressed all round!",Approved
"This is the best induction hob I have had. It so quiet compared to the previous ones I have had. You can tell this is good quality even by looking at the underside. I especially like the Stop and Go and the Child lock functions. It takes hardly no time to boil a litre of water, so no need for a kettle. You will need to have good quality induction cookware to take advantage of MaxiSense. 

However, the Bridge function does not live up to my expectations. When testing, there was little or hardly any heat distribution in the middle of the bridge. Therefore my low rating on features.

This is a very good product and I can recommend it wholeheartedly given you have good cookware and wont rely on the bridge function.",Approved
"A regular 50:50 ""built-in"" fridge freezer. Fitting is straight forward but allow 3-4 hours for diy. The fitting instructions are far from good but by taking it slowly and following the order of fitting it gradually becomes obvious.

There are some ""cold spots"" in the fridge where ice can form but raising the temperature setting from +5 to +6 largely sorted that out with no detriment to anything else in the fridge.

The air circulation system in the freezer does seem to be inhibiting frost formation - but it will be a few more weeks yet before I would like to give this feature the full thumbs up.

Overall the internal design features work well for good packing of food to maximise the use of space. Provided it gives trouble free service over the next few years then I believe it will represents good value for money. The predecessor fridge freezer we had was an earlier similar spec Zanussi model and it lasted nearly 14 years",Approved

"Overall very impressed with this, there isn’t much choice when it comes to purchasing dual gas/induction hobs, but no regrets about buying this unit. 

It’s powerful, fast to heat up and very controllable. 

The individual timers on each ring are great and very useful. 

My only negative is that the touch controls can be a little and miss and the red LED 7 segment displays look a bit dated. 

The only thing missing is internet connectivity, which we have on our ovens and is a very useful feature that I suspect will soon be standard on most appliances.",Approved
The machine works well and is easy to use. Available pods provide a reasonable taste range and work well with the milk frother. Value for money.,Approved
"An all round good product. Smooth lines, easy to clean and an absolute pleasure to use. ( I note that another review commented that it was difficult to clean round knobs - but what knobs are easy to clean around) Excellent ovens, with good temperature control and cakes bake evenly - roasting tins do have a tendency to 'catch' on the base.
Only one quibble with the features and that is that there is not a dual ring on the hob to allow cooking with a small saucepan, apart from this I cannot find anything to complain about.",Approved
"The best feature has to be the flexible cooking zone that now takes all my large cookware...a real bug bear with the previous cooktop I had.
Great quality product highly recommended",Approved
"Very Good. Easy to use, authentic coffee much cheaper than high street stores",Approved
This product is in for repair and is in for repair,Approved
"Firstly, the hob, quite simply, is dangerous. The pan supports are too small to safely support even two small saucepans on the front and back rings on the same side of the hob without one of the pans/saucepans overbalancing. For instance, to have a saucepan and a frying pan in use over the centre of the gas rings on the same side is impossible. To have all four rings in use with pots and pans on is also impossible. There simply is not enough space to support everything safely. We have had an instance where the pan over balanced with hot oil in it, causing the oil to spill onto the hob.

Secondly, the control knobs are too close to the front gas rings and when the gas rings are on the knobs get extremely hot, and too hot to touch to turn the gas either up or down.",Rejected
"Great oven, easy to use, quiet and cooks evenly unlike my last oven",Approved
"Very pleasing overall, BUT, the grill takes for ever to heat to maximu and is very tricky to control after that. I would also like to have a quick-heating element as one of the areas on the surface.",Approved
"From general weekly washing, to bedding, to outdoor wear or the childrens trainers - the wash quality is second to none. Sooo happy with our choice of washing machine. Ease of use, wash cycle options, great practicle features built-in salt dispenser to soften water/ aid maintaining machine, the ability to weigh the dry load at the outset and options for smaller & shorter washes, eco friendly cycles & a large 9kg drum/ load to boot - whats not to love. Sooo enjoying wash day and the improved clean & care our clothes are getting.... one very happy customer!",Approved
"Our first time buying Aeg,very immpressed with the quality and design or this 70/30 Fridge/Freezer with plenty of useful space. Well done on the design, hopefully will last for several years.",Approved
"The quality is there for all to see. Knobs and pan supports feel solid to the touch. The stainless steel finish also looks stylish.

There are some basic design errors. The pan support on the right is angled at the front, falling away to the knobs. This reduces the amount of flat surface area that pans can actuallly sit on. The pan supports are, as usual, formed of grids. This means that for small pans to sit square on each burner, pan handles must always align with the grid. I’m finding that any handle not so aligned means the pan will topple over. Why don’t AEG put extra supports over each burner, thus allowing pans to be placed in any way the user wishes?

I do wonder whether the smallest burner has the power of my previous hob. AEG claim that the burner design is much more efficient than older designs. Technically that might be true, but I have a feeling my old hob’s smallest burner, suitable for boiling eggs in a small pan, was a little quicker. This is only an impression. I have no empirical evidence.",Approved
So far I have found the new hob easy to use. The burners are easy to light and ajust. The stainless steel base is easy to clean as are the cast iron stands,Approved
"The washer has a very easy display which lets you know what’s going on all the way. A very quite motor in all cycles, it is still early days and we keep finding more useful features. A great washer that although more expensive than we intended, it has been worth the extra.",Approved
Up to now the best washing machine we have ever purchased.,Approved
Very disappointing. Looks nice but is completely impractical. On the lowest setting the flame keeps going out. Impossible to slow simmer anything even on lowest setting. Maybe I've got a dodgy one but I expected more from AEG. My old Neff one was much better. Very pricey for something that looks modern and stylish only when not being used,Approved
Took the plunge and bought what I hoped would be a reliable and efficient washer. So far I am confident I made the right choice and the investment will pay off!,Approved
"This Zanussi is everything & more. Very fast, quiet & with 9kg wash space, everything is going to come out clean!
My only problem is, after the wash has finished, there's about 4 tbsps of water, sitting in the rubber seal, which, if not cleaned out, would start to smell & cause mould.",Approved
First week in using the washer it had an error turn on of overflood condition. The AEG engineer found a loose hose connection which he fixed which was leaking. He took a picture to report which he said was a manufacturer fault. The only reason I am giving a four is that we had to wait for the engineer till after Christmas which we were without a working washing machine for five days. The washer has been running excellent since. Really quiet machine. Water softener works great which make you use less detergent per wash. Lets see what the longevity of this machine will be. It came with a five year warranty.,Approved
Great quality machine which makes perfect coffee every time. I would have preferred a plumbed in one as the water tank needs refilling very regularly! Alarms for everything except when the beans container is empty.,Approved
"This is a great hob with excellent burners and a good burner layout. However around 3 weeks after it had been installed we noticed that the whole of the stainless steel surface had developed what appeared to be a pattern of small corrosion marks. The marks got slightly worse after a couple of days so I decided to see if I could remobe them. I have managed to do this using a damp firm sponge and a lot of effort and it took around two hours. One week later the marks have not returned but I will be keeping a check on this. It's difficult to understand why these marks occurred as they quite literally covered the whole surface of the hob rather than being a localised stain, including the area with the controls.

Other than these marks I'm very happy with the cooking performance.",Approved
"Excellent machine, a bit expensive but hopefully it will be worth it. I hope it lasts as long as the one it replaced...",Approved
Im satisfied with this purchase and most likely i would recommend to others,Approved
"This product is well laid out, easy to clean and looks great in my new kitchen. The knobs are easy to use and to ignite burners and the red lighting when lit is a great idea and addition.The knobs do seem a little close to the heat but I am getting used to it.",Approved

"I have had maybe 4 hobs over the last 5 years . Everytime I had to clean it, it would be a hassle, I hated the smears it left behind it. The knobs where temperamental.

This hob is fine but takes a bit of getting used to. You also need the correct pans or it will not work.,Approved
"Good quality cooker, however dislike fixed interval settings on hob and grill and control panel is difficult to clean given it's recessed and has buttons. This was the type of Zanussi cooker stocked by local retailers.",Approved
"This product comes highly recommended went for the largest size and well worth it 90cm.

Easy to dismantle and clean the only negative I can find which comes from a design and personal point of view and does not affect my high recommendation the main rings are screwed down I would have hoped they could have been lifted off like the others.

Other than that FANTASTIC.",Approved
I love my new fridge freezer. This model has all the space and compartments that a small family needs. It’s efficient and environementally friendly. And it looks pretty smart too!,Approved
"Had an AEG induction hob before but droped my crop pot on the side edge still worked but unsafe to use.
Bought another AEG Induction hob same type and design fitted perfectly Good technology - Induction is the way to go, fast -clean - cheaper to run with more control with touch finger operation But you must get new induction pans, don't buy cheap and they are not to get the most out of your hob cooking GOOD LUCK.",Approved
A spacious larder fridge with a massive cooler area at the bottom great for drinks but we use it for veg. It’s so adaptable. And the design is so attractive lots of door storage.,Approved
Although in most respects I am happy with the refrigerator I am surprised and disappointed with the noise that it makes .,Approved
"This is the second hob we have had from zanussi and both have been excellent value for money ,very well designed,and easy to use .
The layout is very good ,easy to keep clean,If wehad not had an accident with the first one we would not have had to change it.The replacement one was easily as good as the first one,and easy to change .
Comes up to recovery quickly and matches our oven .",Rejected
Lots of useful features and a cracking design. Looks great!,Approved
"Only comes with one live connection but needs two, whats that about
actual product is decent and value for money.i",Approved
"The touch controls take getting used to, particularly when the hob turns itself off if water or an object contacts the control panel. But easy to clean and otherwise works well. The quick heat up and the choice of heat ring sizes are useful features",Approved
Really do not like this hob. It's noisy and clicks very loudly when the Power button is on and still clicks when you have more than 1 ring on. The power management is terrible - to use more than 2-4 rings at the same time takes ages to cook anything which you would like at the same time. For example when your cooking vegetables for a Sunday roast instead of for around 15 mins you're looking at 20-25 mins. The ring power is difficult to manage - it's either boil your items or they don't do anything - simmering doesn't happen & if it does it's just luck. Please AEG take this induction hob away and give me a proper one!,Rejected
this cooker is truly the best I've ever bought. it cooks very evenly & it is certainly quicker at cooking our roast than any previous. would always recommend anyone to go for same as you wont be disappointed,Approved
"This scratch’s easy, very hard to keep clean, there is no cleaning product supplied",Approved
"Have only been using it for a week but it looks lovely and smart and easy to use. Need the right ""touch"" though sometimes on the surface to press the area where you want to turn on/off or set heat.",Approved
Bought this machine to replace an old Hotpoint on the advice of the sales person. Really pleased so far the machine is very easy to use and very quiet. I was concerned re the cost but I think it is probably money well spent. So impressed that I am now considering purchasing the tumble dryer to match!,Approved
Bought this freezer to replace old one and looked at most makes but nothing came close to this one. Perfect under counter freezer with loads of storage space and love the fact that all the compartments have easy pull out drawers. Some reviews do say the fronts of the drawers mist over when you open the freezer door but I honestly haven't found this to be a problem - I open the drawer to look in anyway. Overall this beats my last freezer hands down and would definately recommend it.,Approved
"Installed by the builder. Bellway, the support grid on this hob is badly designed and dangerous. There is no pan support on the corners and a small movement of a heavy pan from the centre of the any burner in a diagonal movement will bring the pan and boiling contents to the floor.
This has happened on t number of occasions with various pans,, due to failure of sufficient diagonal support.
I have informed the builders who are to investigate. Though I hold no design fault with them only yourselves the manufacture.

David. Gregory",Rejected
"Although the general quality is acceptable for the prize, the main problem with this appliance is its ""pan supporter"" design, which constitutes a serious hazard, due pans do not sit properly. Since we bought ir last July it has caused a few domestic accidents in the house, because of pans keep sliding from it.",Rejected
bought on the strengh of a good review on 'Which?'. The ovens are indeed very big but at the expense of the position of the knobs which are inconvenient when getting stuff out of an oven - you automatically want to slide it onto the hob; they also get dirty quickly there. Seems to cook fine. More expensive than it need be due to having to have the programmer/timer,Approved
"The open gauze grease filter just isn't up to the job, and already (5 months) we have a build-up of grease *inside* the appliance. It also pools on the gauze before dripping back onto the hob. It looks like I have to fork-out another £57 for the springy bits of metal in order to use the universal cut-to-fit filter material that you can get in the shops.",Rejected
Does the job efficiently but would benefit from a door operated on/off micro switch. Reaching up to locate the slide control can be difficult especially for the mobility impaired.,Approved
a must have coffee maker. we are hooked on lavazza coffee and this is the best machine to make it,Approved
"nice and easy to use, though buying the capsules in shops is almost impossible.",Approved
My cooker broke on New Year's Day so had to decide what make cooker I wanted had heard about aeg how good they where I gave not been disappointed it bakes great cake and easy to use I also bought a aeg job to match and that's easy to use I love them both would recommend,Approved
The hob seems good quality and easy to use. In particular the control over the heat is very responsive.,Approved
"This is much quieter than my previous dishwasher. I like the countdown display and the 30 min wash. The racks seem smaller thank my other machine, which had the same overall dimensions, this makes loading a bit more difficult. Overall I am pleased with the dishwasher but it has one odd habit of adding an extra 15 minutes to the end of the 30 min wash so that it actually takes 45 minutes.",Approved
Ideal cooker with slick appearence and intuitive controls,Approved
"Good product, like the left hand or right hand air vent which make it easy to plum in. Other models are mainly one way only. Drys cloths easy, would have like a time taken but not a problem.",Approved
"Cant say I am impressed so far, only had it 6 months & I have had 3 visits from engineers to fix it. Had previous Zanussi for 15 years & the only problem was the wheels on the baskets corroding.",Approved
Quality fridge with ample capacity for family of 4,Approved
we like the sleek design of the hob and oven controls- no knobs to trap grease-. Baking results excellent. Bakes and roasts perfectly without drying food out.,Approved
"I had a 3 year old AEG top of range Modo Mio that developed a fault. It was cheaper to replace than get fixed. First I bought a Minu Latte Machine. That was uttterly useless, so 
I returned that and bought this one, which falls between the two. It’s much better than the Minu Latte but not as good as my old machine.
The disappointments are. 1 small water tank. 2 weakish flow of cofffe and 3 much less crema produced than my last Machine 

So for the money it’s an OK purchase but not quite as good as I had expected",Approved
"I bought the induction Hob on John Lewis website to get a good service, I thought it would be safer...to start the Hob wasn't offered with any installation or technical service, it also didn't come with a cable to plug it in. I contacted JL by phone and email and the answers were so varied and very different. I took the hob back to JL Oxford and again they were surprised that JL hasn't been able to help or provide any answer. They organised a Tech electrician who came today and instead of installing a cable on the hob blamed our electric installation which has received another AEG induction hob for the last 10 years. Allow me to be frustrated and not satisfied, I will look into doing it myself, sure that Utube can be a better service provider than JL.",Rejected
"I was quite surprised when I saw the quality of this hob given the price. The controls are very discreet and precise, looks good and easy to keep clean. I am extremely pleased with my purchase.",Approved
Our first machine developed a fault but was immediately replaced under warranty once we found the correct phone number to contact - not the one in the instructions.,Approved
"I wish I had read the reviews, absolutely useless, will not dry even half a load. It just turns itself off after 3 hours and refuses to restart in program mode. We have had an engineer out twice but both times have been told the machine is working because the diagnostic cycle says it is. 

Customer services then did nothing but refer us back to the retailer but took 2 weeks to do so citing their engineers report as being gospel. Both engineers told us the machines were poor quality but they had to report no fault as that is what the diagnostics said.",Rejected
Our first induction hob and I doubt we will use anything other in the future. This particular model is easy to use and gets up to temperature rapidly. Really like the sleek finish. The only downside is having to keep wiping it down to remove any smear marks.,Approved
"Bought this to replace gas hob. Pleased with product, very effective. Only downside is that it scratches easily and therefore alters the look of the hob.",Approved
We have the machine for almost a year. We use it every day. We are delighted with its performance and would highly recommend it,Approved
"This was the only side opening oven that would fit to replace my previous Zanussi built-in oven.
The controls are not digital and 50 degrees between markings so are very inaccurate.
The knobs are huge and being below a hob, one has to bend right over to see what temperature you are setting...this would not be a problem if it were an eye level oven
Oven shelves have dips, presumably for safety, but makes removing oven trays very tricky (i have turned them upside down but they feel a little precarious)
When oven or grill are on there is a blast of very hot steamy air when you open the door.
However the door closes much better than my previous one did.
Early days but I am not enamoured",Approved
"Overall I am pleased with this oven, it heats up quickly and has a good even temperature.
A couple of points though, the numbers are under the dials so it's designed to be at eye level not under a counter. It needs to be switched on at the wall all the time otherwise the clock resets to 12:00 and the oven doesn't work until the time is set. It arrived with no cable or plug and we had to use the cable from the old oven.",Approved
"I chose to go from 30 years of using a gas hob/cooker to an induction. I wasn’t sure if I was going to get on with it, I only bought it as it looked more minimalist than a gas hob and knew it would be easier to clean.
It is very easy to use and very responsive. It has taken a couple of months to get used to it but I would now never change back to gas. My induction hob is safer, easier to clean and looks amazing. You do need induction compatible cookware but that’s really easy to get hold of now. The only disappointing thing is within two weeks of cooking on it, I have somehow managed to badly scratch the glass. When it first happened I was mortified but now I guess I have come to think of it as “it’s there to be used and isn’t going to stay pristine forever”. Even though it was easy to scratch, I would still go for another induction when this one needs replacing. I recommend induction hobs to everyone now and after extensive research and eventually plumping for AEG, I know I have made the right choice.",Approved
"Having previously owned an AEG cooker with a double oven and ceramic hob, was an easy decision to make when we had a new kitchen put in...can't fault this hob, is an induction hob, very easy to use and clean....you can heat up all of one side too for larger pans.
It not only works well but looks good too, although have only been using for a ferw days, I know the build quality is there...we also chose an AEG double oven and an AEG cooker hood....perfect.",Approved
Very east to use and keep clean. 1st induction hob I have owned and wonder why I didn’t have one before,Approved
"We was given this product for free from AEG in return for an honest review.

The Induction Hob is fantastic. I have used this more in the few weeks we have had it than my previous gas hob I had for a few years. Responsiveness is great, and has made me enjoy my cooking more than ever.

The Stop and Go feature is great, and allows us to pause cooking if needed. The bridging feature is our favorite feature though, as this allows us to bridge two zones together and use one of our bigger frying pans on the hob.

The timer is what is required and very easy to use, whilst to switch between power levels with the touch and drag option is very useful and user friendly.

Overall this item is a fantastic product, full of useful features and very user friendly, and helps deliver fantastic results. I can guarantee this will make your cooking more enjoyable!",Approved
I bought this lavazza fantasia in order to have good coffee at home and save myself money by not buying expensive coffees on the high street. I love it. The machine is easy to use and maintain. The milk is warmed as well as frothed. You have options to have all sizes and types of coffees. I personally love flat whites and this machine is excellent for making them. Save yourself a lot of money and buy one!,Approved
"out of 4 burners one was giving problems, so in future test them before putting on market.",Approved
absolutely love my new coffee machine. so easy to use and makes wonderful thick milky foam.,Approved
Quick to heat up and easy to clean. Haven’t used all the features yet but 8mpressed with how easy it is and how quiclky I can change the temperature.,Approved
Great tasting coffee and frothy milk on demand! This machine is so easy to use I have been having more coffee than is good for me! I have had milk frothers before but they always failed because water gets in when you clean them. This design is genius because there are no electrical components in the part that you clean so it cannot fail. Good range of coffee pods available but my favourites are Dolce and the decaf Dek pods which unlike some other decaf coffee pods has a good strong taste.,Approved
"The machine is easy to use and makes really nice coffee. The milk frother is great for making long coffees as well and being dishwasher safe is easy to keep clean.
Overall a really nice machine.",Approved
"The installation instructions are appalling!  Lord help any diy installation!

Getting at the cable connections is not explained at all - after unscrewing the cable clamp (T20 Screw) there are two clips that a flat head screwdriver will release but they are far from obvious. The whole electrical connection 'box' appears 'value engineered'

You will need a Torx20 screwdriver to make the electrical connections. If yo don't have one you will not be able to undo the connection screws.

It is necessary to link the terminals (this is shown clearly on the back) but what isn't shown is where to find the links (A: clipped next to the cable clamp)

What should AEG do? 
1. Install both links for single cable  connection in the factory. If there are two live feeds to the hob then one of the links isn't needed - this is clearly shown on the back of the item. One link is needed irrespective of the number of cables.
2. Put a sticker on the back of the device showing how to open the cable connection area. (and if they aren't going to put the links on in the factory show where to find the links.

Once installed the product is Good and appears to cook evenly and quickly it is a significant improvement over the ancient ceramic hob we inherited with the house and comparable to or better than gas.

Ultimately I would recommend the hob but AEG need to do a far better job on the installation instructions.",Approved
"A very powerful hob.

My main criticism is that any slight spillage near the touch panel and it turns itself off, it also doesn't allow you to use the controls with wet hands.",Approved
Having moved from gas I was a little nervous but love how easy these appliances are to use and quick to heat. Great quality products,Approved
An excellent hob that provides good flexibility with regard to pan position...useful on an induction hob. Easy to clean and an asset to the kitchen.,Approved
"We were unlucky to receive a faulty product, as it failed after about a week (having only been used once or twice). These things happen, however I was very disappointed by the service trying to sort it out. AEG outsource their repair services. As a result, when I called to let them know about the faulty hob I spoke not to AEG but somebody from 'Response Services'. It took ages to get through, and when I did the person on the phone demonstrated no care or attention to what had happened, and simply booked in a repair in 14 days time! I thought this was unacceptable but emailing AEG using a form on their website was useless, I didn't get a reply. The retailer sorted it out in the end but there was no end of hassle and even though I replaced it with a new AEG model I'm still out of pocket.",Rejected
Product excellant great space and easy to adjust temp ect .excellant layout would recommend every time,Approved
"After buying new pans for this hob which were exspensive but as the user manual said a magnet stuck to the bottom very well they were taking about 12 minutes to heat up. Worked fine on a friends induction hob so i tried another exspensive pan with the same results. In the end i got a cheap pan and it worked perfectly and very quickly, so the user manual is a little misleading by saying any magnetic pan will work as it does but not to the standard amd speed you would expect from a induction hob. Now that has been sorted the hob is brilliant and i would recommend to others.",Approved
I've only had my fridge freezer for a few weeks but I absolutely love it. There is plenty of room in both the fridge and the freezer. You can adjust the temperature of the fridge easily. It is very quiet unlike most fridge freezers.,Approved
"This is my third induction hob and by far the best. Good power boost on all zones, bridge zones are great. It looks fantastic when off, just a black glass surface that comes to life when you touch the on control. So far cannot fault.",Approved
"Had 3 Lazazza coffee machines under 2 year warranty, first one lasted 22 months and loved the machine and coffee, second 2 leaked from the start",Approved
"We needed to replace the large 30+ year-old Zanussi freezer that we kept in the shed which has given great service in that time, but was probably no where near as efficient as today's models. This is smaller (small enough to fit in our store-room in the house) but perfect for us 2 as the chldren have now left home. Having now had it several months, I can report that it maintains a good -18 to -20 centigrade on the normal setting, while at the same time reducing our electricity bills by about 15-20%. Should have done it years ago!",Approved
Love this Larder Fridge but find the door extremely difficult to open. It takes a determined yank which sets off the contents rattling.,Approved
"I love this hob, its literrally impossible for things to boil over. You may think think that things afent boiling but however it works is great!!",Approved
"Both my wife and I cook on a regular basis and are thrilled with the variable settings on the ring sizes.
There is a decent size double ring to take a fish kettle or to back gravy direct from the baking pan.
A center 3 multi ring in three sizes to allow for pans up to Pressure Cooking size to fit safely on the hob.
Two more variable rings on the other side.
The controls are simple to use and the heat control is almost immediate.
There is a master switch to make sure the total hob is turned off and indicators to warn you of rings that may still be hot. All in all a nice addition to our kitchen.",Approved
"We have had nothing but trouble from day 1 after installing this induction hob.
It has continually had an electrical fault that has tripped the RCD dozens of times.
Engineers have been troublesome and unreliable and we still dont have an operational hob despite various parts having been replaced. The unit wont even power up since the engineers started changing parts so the situation has got progressively worse.",Approved
We had this microwave installed above our in line AEG double oven and it looks great. It has a great many features without all the clutter of loads of buttons and dials - very minimal design. Overall very happy with another great AEG product.,Approved

Wonderful product. Well made and works well. Standard AEG.,Approved
"Impressive style & design, completes my kitchen beautifully. Also matches the AEG freezer, achieving a sophisticated look.",Approved
"Sadly the door does not shut well. We close the door, but go back to the fridge a while later only to find it ajar! It appears closed when you just shut it, but something pushes it open again.",Approved
The item supplied had a faulty door-open alarm so the alarm kept going off even when there was no need. The drawers on rollers are not strong enough to be able to fully use them and are just not fit for purpose.,Approved
I was particularly impressed with the design and robustness of the internal drawers and shelves. Many fridge freezers are let down by cheap flimsy internals. The compressor is quiet in operation and hardly noticeable. Altogether a good purchase,Approved
The only thing I would like is an extra shelf. Otherwise the fridge is absolutely perfect,Approved
Bought this to replace a built in fridge as our built in fridge wasted so much space at the bottom. Really pleased with it,Approved
Sadly this product developed a fault after a week and we are still awaiting a repair from the authorised repair agent after two months. Wait times on the phone and then for engineering appointments very bad. I wouldn;t have bought this product if I had known that the service was this bad.,Rejected
Good product well pleased delivery on time would use again,Approved
"Good quality product, choice of options to get the taste required. Varying cup options.",Approved
"A great purchase, neatly fitting in to our utility room and matching (silver) with our other appliances. Bright fridge light enables you to see the whole of the fridge and the glass shelves are so easy to keep clean.",Approved
"We moved into a new house with all new appliances. Initially the washing machine didn't seem to be performing to specification and we kept getting error messages. As they were new we didn't know whether it was how we were using or a fault, A techician came out and identified that the drain pipe had been squashed at the back on installation and this meant the water could not drain away correctly. The pipe was replaced under warranty but we feel the washing machine should not have been installed incorrectly in the first place.",Approved
"Only criticism is that programme takes a lot longer than the time indicated on the machine, therefore using more power. I find that a bit surprising.",Approved

Great concept to have 2 vegetable boxes.
What a pity that the bottles holder is not included in this fridge.",Approved
"Large fridge freezer. Non frost free fridge, but all frost free systems are bad for your veggies, open packs cheese etc, because the frost free systems dry out the air very quickly. In two days all veggies look like they have been inside for a week, but not with this fridge. For me non frost system fridge is better option as it is this model. I never seen any ice inside, so generaly it is very well designed and you never need to turn it off for defrost.",Approved
"I have only had this fridge freezer for just over a month and it has broken down. I would expect it to be a lot better than that. The fridge is of a large size but the compartments on the fridge door do not have enough depth, so you are limited to what you can put in them, even with moving them around.
The freezer works out to be pretty small because of the width of the walls of it.",Approved
"I am extremely pleased with my new cooker. Great to use and looks great too. Excellent service also from the supplier Furness H eating, Barrow in F Furness who supplied and fitted cooker. Couldn't be happie",Rejected
The grill seems to be pointless although we may not have tested it thoroughly,Approved
"This is a stylish looking fridge with much more storage space than our old Zanussi. The light is nice and bright making it easy to see what you're looking for. So far, it has been almost silent which is also a welcome feature.
Highly recommened.",Approved
"We had a similar model before and this offers all the features we want, frost free and efficient.",Approved
"I was originally delighted with the look of the hob but the diagonal burners are a nightmare! If you have 2 pans on the side burners, there is no room to put anything on the back. If you try it either pushes the others off or you risk serious burns trying to reach over the other hot pans. Similarly ,if you try to use the front burner with other pans, your boiling pan can end up in the floor!!! I will now have to buy a replacement hob with standard burners.
I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS FIT FOR PURPOSE",Rejected
"FIrstly I have to say, that I have been chosen to receive this product by the manufacturer, in return for a full & Frank review of the product!
I've always been a lover of gas hobs, as they heat up quickly.....when I moved to this house last year, I became the owner of a ceramic hob....hated it with a passion! Took so long to warm up, then way too long to cool down! I've lost count of the amount of times the kids have melted a plastic storage container on the hob, so I was very eager to trial the AEG Induction hob!
When we had it installed, my daughter was the first to trial it out by making poached eggs for brunch....we very quickly learned that none of our pots & pans were suitable, & whilst darling daughter then made scrambled eggs in the microwave instead, we rushed off to the local supermarket to buys some new pots & pans!
That evening I trialled it with making a seafood linguine, OMG! The water boiled up so quickly, that it made my cooking so much quicker! Its fantastic, it heats up quickly & cools down quickly too....in fact, it heats up so quickly that I've also rushed out & invested in an Induction kettle, as it boils so quickly! I'm pretty sure that it will now also cut down on my electricity bills, as the induction only heats up where it needs to, & reaches boiling heat really quickly, no need to boil the kettle now before cooking veg, potatoes, or pasta!! Whoop whoop"" So pleased, in fact, I have already recommended it to two of my friends who are getting their kitchens remodelled! :)",Approved
"We looked for quite some time for a freestanding cooker that came up with the looks and practical elements of the product that we ordered. So far, so good, not disappointed at all.",Approved
"We were delighted that AEG selected us to receive this hob free of charge in return for an honest review of its performance, which is what I will attempt to do.
Firstly, you have to say that this is a stunning looking addition to the kitchen. If, like us, your kitchen and its island have quickly become the hub of the family and the center of attention for visiting guests, then this understated yet modern looking centerpiece is an excellent choice.
But its not all about looks, and this hob had a lot to do to win me over, as I have always loved gas in the past for speed and control. This was not helped by the sudden realization that not only was my wok entirely the wrong shape, but more than half of our pans were not conductive at all, or very poor.
As a result, investing in Induction does lead to investing in new pans, though if we were honest, they were past their best.
So, armed with shiny new pans and even a new fangled flat base wok we set about trying out many different styles of cooking. We had complete success, the hob works as good as it looks, I am a gas convert!! The speed it warms things up is amazing, way more controllable than gas and much safer, as the surround hardly gets warm at all.
The family cat literally stepped over a pan of boiling potatoes before we could catch him and did not bat an eyelid.
It looks great, it cooks amazingly quickly, cleans up perfectly and is incredibly safe for kids and cats alike, there really is nothing to fault.
At first we struggled a little with the range of features the buttons provide access to, but, once mastered there is nothing not to like.",Approved
Fine as a basic dryer but the older version it replaced had a better door mechanism and a countdown timer to see how long was left and it switched off when finished rather than sitting there with lights on waiting for you to turn it off.

"Although I really didn't want to change my previous fridge, it was a shelf sliding model, the freezer packed up and we found it inconvenient to have it sit on the floor. We'd seen this larder fridge some time ago and said if we ever replaced our old one, this is the one we'd go for. The quality is outstanding, the feel of the door is solid and the cooler drawers are of a good depth and smooth operation. If I was to have anything to criticise, it is just not having a few more dividers in the door trays, but that is all. Very glad we bought this.",Approved

"I am thrilled to have been selected by AEG to review their state of the art HK854400FB induction hob. I had been looking to replace my old hob when AEG offered me this hob free of charge in exchange for my honest review of the product.

I have been a user of induction for the past 15 years and would never buy anything else. I have two young children who enjoy cooking with me and induction offers a level of safety that no other hob does. There are no exposed flames or burning hot surfaces that can hurt little hands, and the hob offers the additional safety of a child safety lock.

The fantastic MaxiSense feature of this hob detects the size and shape of the pan you use and immediately adjusts its heat output to fit the saucepan used. There is no loss of heat and you are not restricted as to the size of pan you can use anywhere on the hob. Due to the extra large 80 cm width it is possible to use 4 large saucepans at the same time. The hob is incredibly responsive. Changes in temperature are virtually instantaneous making it very energy efficient and so easy to use. Using the power booster water boils incredibly fast so I no longer use my electric kettle. The Stop & Go function is great for when the telephone rings. You press one button and all zones on the hob are turned down to keep warm. When pressed again, the zones return to their previous settings.

In addition to the hobs incredible functionality, controllability, and efficiency I love how easy it is to clean. A very quick wipe with a damp cloth over the perfectly smooth dark glass and the hob is sparkling clean. Great!",Approved
"Once installing the oven, just simply followed the instruction before using it. I did put full maximum temperature to allow it to get used effectively. Unfortunately only small of catacytic liner chipped off at the lower oven. A engineer was called and carried out the test. It is advisable to keep a eye on this. So far, it's slightly chipped off a bit more.

Overall it is a satisfying oven, but it takes a while to match the right temperature. Only the downside is that there is no exact figure of temperature, no marked i.e. 180˚c, 220˚c.",Approved

A straightforward fridge freezer with sufficient capacity for normal small family requirements. There is an absence of gimmicks and controls and operation are simple. The only criticism is the salad crisper is split in two sections. It would be better if his was a single unit because the current size limits the capacity of each section such that items such as celery cannot be accommodated.,Approved

Of all the tumble dryers both myself and members of my family have owned ,(Hotpoint ,Hoover etc, I think we've had them all between us in the past) this one beats them all hands down, washing comes out as dry and fresh as if it had been on an outdoor washing line.

"I was considering replacing my previous 9 year old AEG cooker with a new model AEG as it had started to show signs of wear over the past 12 months and was taking forever to cook anything, but after reading through reviews on different websites , and comparing specifications I decided on the zanussi , I must say I am absolutely delighted with it! It cooks perfectly every time,it's easy to use, heats up really quickly, and is so easy to clean. Another bonus is the extra shelf, after only having 2 shelves and a grill tray in the AEG I find it so much easier having 3, the retractable knobs (same as on AEG ) make for a really sleek finish too! I would highly recommend this cooker for its efficiency, looks and value for money.",Approved
"Having looked at a few integrated fridge/freezers for our new kitchen, we were pleased that we chose this one. It is very quiet. It has lots of storage space with adjustable shelving in the fridge compartment, which is brightly illuminated.

The freezer compartment has four good sized draws, and the temperature controls for both compartments are easy to use, with good visual displays.",Approved

Can't really fault this fridge freezer as I've only had it for a few months. It seems to work well and the temperature displays are very reassuring that temperatures are being maintained. My only one niggling point is that it seems a bit noisy when the motor is running. Not sure whether this is a machine fault or as a result of its built in fitting.,Approved

Very disappointed in the product as a whole. Not enough shelves in the fridge. Salad drawer would be better if it was two separate ones rather than just one. Doesn't keep vegetables as fresh as well.

"As far as fridges go, there's nothing really to recommend this. The interior space is small, the runners that support the large plastic drawer at the bottom have broken some 10 months after purchase, AND after calling 3 times already, I still have not received a replacement for them.

Also, the fridge doesn't close well unless you virtually lean on it. Our previous self-standing fridge closed itself if you simply let go of the door.

I wish I had not allowed my wife to dictate the fridge should be hidden behind a panel that matches the rest of our kitchen. I could have had one that has a plumbed-in ice maker and water dispenser. This design is just lazy.",Approved
"We are used to the noises that Zanussi fridges and freezers make but this model makes a ""cracking"" noise when the compressor is working. The fridge is located in the kitchen and we can hear the ""crack"" in our lounge even when the television is on!

Had a built in fridge freezer before and now have separate ones which is excellent as they are far more spacious (obviously!) so you can store goods in an orderly way. Easy to see what you have even on the top shelf.,Approved

"THIS FRIDGE IS A FRIDGE AND NOT A FRIDGE FREEZER WITH A FRIDGE!! It's great for the TALL and great for the small people ~ easy access at all levels. Open the door and every thing is in view and readily accessible.
The salad drawer and the meat drawer work really well and seem to increase the lifespan of the salads/vegs/meat. The coolmatic system works well when restocking the fridge. The fridge itself looks really KOOOL and is quiet. The only down side for us was that it needed a extra glass shelf which we had to purchase separately. Highly recommended!!",Approved

"I received AEG HK854400FB as part of the AEG review program in return for an honest product review.

In the past I had favoured gas hobs but had never tried induction. My gripe with gas is that they are a nightmare to clean, and there is never enough flexibility over the burners, you are limited thier size. A large burner can only go so low or vice versa.

I wanted to try the AEG HK854400FB for 2 reasons. Firstly the contemporary look and secondly the huge cooking space.

I had heard induction hobs can bring a pan to boil quickly, but was amazed to see how quickly the HK854400FB does it! You can be bring, pasta, rice or quinoa etc to a boil in about a minutes which smashes cooking times to pieces! Jamie could get his twenty minutes down to ten if he had one of these!

Something I was not expecting is the amount of control you have over each burner. You can be stir-frying chicken on a high heat and then bring it down in seconds to a mild heat, allowing you to create your sauce. The result is much more flavoursome and better-cooked food.

In addition you’re not limited to where the pans are placed, because each burner is as gentle or powerful as you want, you can break the mould of cooking the main at the front and veg behind which gives you a huge amount of versatility and space which I really like.

Lastly the hob being all glass is great, not only does it look futuristic but it’s so easy to keep clean. I even like the hidden controls which I was dubious about. The individual burner timer is really useful however I could not get the auto boil function to work without boiling over - although I found as it brings a pot up to high heat so fast iI'm not sure it is needed.

I am an induction convert, this hob is AMAZING!",Approved
Absolutely stunning product. Couldn't recommend enough. Great features. Love the Hob2Hood,Approved
"Th induction hob is very good, the best I have used Very fine control over the heat settings is possible and the four sizes provide many options. The 'power boost' is a very helpful feature.

By contrast the main oven is very disappointing. Fine control of oven temperature is impossible. The worse feature is the control of temperature at the low end of the scale. The minimum temperature setting of the oven provides far too high a temperature for keeping food warm; comparing very unfavorably with every other cooker I have used. The only way I can achieve the temperature I want is by turning the oven off after a timed period of heating!",Approved
"The plastic door pockets and drawers are quite brittle. The split half glass shelves, one of them has fallen out and smashed as they don't seem to be fixed together.

The temperature gauge at the top reads the temp you have set it to, I'd much prefer it read the actual temperature in the fridge.

It doesn't seem to maximize space as much as my old hotpoint FF200 fridge despite it being bigger, I feels smaller.",Approved
"I have found the product easy to use with no problems to report it dryers all I put in and removing filter and water is easy
Dryers clothing quicker than a dryer previously used

I reccomend this product",Approved
"As a new convert, from Gas, to Induction cooking, I was somewhat concerned that I might be making a retrograde move. But it's definitely been the right decision and this Hob delivers everything I had hoped for. Manageability of power is immediate (just like Gas) and there is more than enough power to do anything that I will ever want; I'm gradually getting used to what a power setting means, compared to the visual cue of a Gas flame, but the saving grace, during this learning phase, is the immediacy of control. The completely flat working surface is a joy, especially after messing about with burners and frames and all the junk that comes with a traditional Gas Hob: cleaning could not be simpler or quicker.",Approved
"I own the predecessor to this appliance – the Zanussi ZRB32313WA

I initially bought this fridge, back in September 2013, because of the limited width my kitchen has available.
At 59.5cm wide, it really does ‘just’ fit into the space. (A 60cm wide fridge would be scratched if forced into the space.)

When I first started to search for a fridge-freezer, I was concerned that I would be limited to a few options, of basic machine with awful specifications and possibly cheap quality.
During my search, I found the Zanussi range offered this perfect width, but was also a high-spec’ machine (with a high energy rating of A+) but was also generous with internal space. It wasn’t cheap either at £419.99 I was buying something better than average.

I found that various sellers actually sell this same machine under variations of the same model number – the differences between each ‘version’ was as simple as the graphics stuck on the drawers, or how many plastic shelves are supplied for the fridge compartment.

The machine was bought locally from a Euronics store and was specially ordered in. It was delivered a few days later. It fitted perfectly into that 59.5cm space I had for it.
Perfect. When it use it made those ‘common’ fridge-freezer sounds, like bussing and the occasional crack. (At first these were alarming but there was a guide with the instructions that cleverly demonstrate the various noises the machine will make.)

I found the internal space fantastic for my needs:
For the fridge, a couple of bottles of wine in the rack, plenty of door shelving for my fruit juice, dairy items, and the two drawers fine for my vegetables. The rest of the trays held various other things like jams and chutneys.
For the freezer, the three drawers were great for storing meat and stock. For a single person, I could easily store a month’s work of meat and frozen veg.

Then after 7 months of use, in April 2014, the machine stopped working. I went away to a relatives on Friday night and returned on the Sunday to find the machine silent.
I opened the fridge to find it warm, and smelly – food was rotting. I opened the freezer to find it barely cold, and the meat had thawed out. All that food had to be thrown out. I wasn’t happy. I contacted the seller, who passed me onto Zanussi.
The machine has a 12-month warranty, and so an engineer came out a couple of days later. He repaired the machine within about an hour, and essentially ‘re-gassed’ the appliance. A few hours later it was all back up and running, and I could get about re-stocking it with food. All was fine.

It turned one year old in September 2014, and so the warranty expired.

At the end of November 2014, at 14 months old, I returned from a couple of nights away. It was Sunday afternoon and I returned to find machine has stopped working again. This is 7 month after the initial repair. I wasn’t happy, and also very aware that the warranty had expired.
As with the first failure, the machine was silent. Once again, the fridge was warm (warmer than the actual kitchen) and stinky. And once again, the freezer was full of thawed meat, and warm, too. And once again I threw away a lot of spoiled food.

I contacted Zanussi on the Monday morning. During that day, I made three phone-calls (each lasting around 30 minutes). I explained the problem, and was advised that an out-of-warranty service would be £115. I refused to pay this given the age of the machine, and the fact it had already failed once before. I asked to speak to someone about a replacement machine, and was advised I’d be called back. This happened for the first two phone-calls – as nobody returned my call.
The third call was pretty much the same, expect this time it was 5.15pm and most of the office had left for the day. I was given the Customer Care email address and advised to write in.

So, that Monday evening I emailed the Zanussi/Electrolux Customer Care department and explained exactly what had happened. I also sent this email to my local Euronics store as well as the main Euronics customer service email.

A week has no passed, and it’s early December (writing this review on 6th December).
In that time I have not had any response from Zanussi, nothing from Euronics, and one call from my local Euronics store that have supposedly contacted Zanussi themselves. I even contacted Zanussi UK via Facebook and Twitter, who have simply passed my contact details to the Customer care team.

Having spent over £400 on an appliance, I would expect it to last well beyond 14 months. (My previous fridge-freezer was a Hotpoint, cost £400, and lasted me 3 years before I sold it with my flat to the new owner.)
I appreciate that machines do fail, and that is why we have warranty periods, but the value of the product also implies its quality. This machine hasn’t lived up to its retail value.
Also, given the age of the appliance, the customer should not be willing to pay out £115 to repair a fault that has occurred twice. In both cases I’ve been forced to throw away food that was never reimbursed, so why should I keep losing money for a faulty product?

The appalling level of customer service is simply unprofessional. I find it infuriating that customers can be treated this way – if I treated customers in this manner, I would be fired with immediate effect.

So, given my rant, do I recommend this machine? No.
Would I look at buying anything from Zanussi again? No.

Stay away from this product, and possibly any fridge-freezer produced by Zanussi, unless you really like throwing money away and receiving the worst possible customer experience.",Rejected
This cooker is not designed with much thought for the convenience of the user. The ignition system is particularly awkward as you have to hold the buttons in for too long in order to ensure lighting.

Fixing brackets were missing in the box and I was disappointed to find the Cooler was made in PRC not the EU as expected from other AEG purchases.",Approved

"Sadly I cannot possibly recommend anyone buying a Zanussi product. I bought a fridge freezer with a value of approximately £600 and after two years the bottom of the freezer door started to bubble and rust despite it being kept in ideal home conditions in a centrally heated modern house occupied by one singleton with regular housekeeping. On contacting Zanussi I got a response as though I owned an antique product and what I did I expect after that length of ownership. Be warned people.﻿

Purchased in September 2013 its now 17/05/16 and the fan is now faulty, part and repair cost half the price of a new fridge freezer. Luckily I have my old fridge (of 18+yrs) in the shed as back up.

"Purchased with new kitchen. Hob looks lovely and really sets the kitchen off. However I have had 2 induction hobs prior to this and this is the worst quality. Neither of the other 2 had a mark on them after several years of use this one has been used for 2 months and is covered in scratches. Quality of the ceramic is not very Goodall all. Quality is very cheap considering the price! I purchased new pans too. The layout of the cooking areas is also a bit awkward. The 4 corners need to be further in and not set back as far. The middle hob which should be the main one feels like you have to stretch to comfortably stir a pan. I find the power function very useful however I find that I have to have a pan up very high just to simmer. The controls are way to sensitive too, just simply leaning over can cause the hob to turn off mid cook.  The alarm is very quiet, if you have your extractor going chances are you will not hear it. It’s great to have 5 cooking areas the extra flexibility is good but apart from that I really can’t recommend this product. I would advise people to shop around. Cook and Lewis are much better quality. I feel I will need to replace this product sooner rather than later just because of appearance.",Approved

"This hob is incredible. With it's flexible cooking zones, it is really efficient and simple to use. I particularly like the power slide function, where you can preset three zones for different levels of heat. This is a really clever function which I enjoy using.

The hob has an automatic switch off mode which prevents nasty problems. The heat settings are easy to use simply by sliding your finger along the control bar. Timers and locks are available but I seldom use these.

Should something boil over, the hob will switch off and cleaning up is easy. There is also an advanced automatic function which connects the hob to a special hood. Sadly we do not have that hood but I use the indicator light on the hob as my guide as to when to switch our hood on.

This induction hob provides everything I need and makes cooking enjoyable and easy.",Approved

"This induction hob replaced an earlier model and the additional features are most welcome. There are different size induction areas to match various pan sizes, the rapid heat up option is very useful for boiling, frying etc. and the level of heat control is extremely precise as well as being straightforward and very easy to use. The individual timer function for each induction area is an excellent additional feature. There is also a function which allows infrared connection to the extractor unit to automatically control the rate of extraction to match the intensity of the cooking on the hob - however this requires a compatible extractor hood (which I do not have) so I have been unable to try out this function. The unit is attractive and the controls are highly intuitive so there is no need for frequent reference back to the instruction manual. Easy to clean and maintain its pristine looks with a soft cloth and water and occasional specialist induction hob cleaner.",Approved

"AEG IKB64301FB INDUCTION HOB. I previously owned a gas hob and I never thought that i would ever go electric and now I'm kicking myself wishing I'd done it sooner. Not only does it look amazing in my kitchen the display is easy to use and you have so much control over the temperature. I could not believe how quickly it would boil water, I can boil a pot of water in less than 60 Seconds, its simply amazing. Furthermore, the product is very easy to clean which helps save a lot of time in the kitchen and helps keep my kitchen appear spotless. In addition, this model also makes cooking a lot more safer and easier, the pot handles and lid remain at warm temperatures so you do not need to worry about getting burnt, also the actual heating pods do not get very hot due to it being induction so you don't have to worry when cleaning or accidentally burning yourself, which is efficient when you have children or teens around, as they are much safer and they can also get more involved in the kitchen which is good for themselves when learning how to cook. Lastly, the hob also has a feature where you can adjust the extractor fan from the hob, but unfortunately I do not have an AEG extractor so i can not test out this feature, but it will be next item of purchase so i can test all the functions available on the Hob and write a full review. Overall, all I can say is that I highly recommend you purchase one of these induction hobs, its fast,safe and easy to use and look truly amazing and really is worth the money and will significantly improve your kitchen experience.

Water boils in half the time. It does take trial and error for making sauces etc but once mastered no problem. For me it’s the cleaning that has been a life changer. I’m very particular, it used to take me a good 15 to 30 minutes after dinner to clean gas hob now it’s a spray and wipe taking less than a minute....bliss!",Approved

"This hob replaces an older AEG induction hob and there is quite a marked difference in terms of heating power, control and ease of use. With decent induction pans water boils extremely quickly (around 60-90seconds). The controls are really easy to use. To change the amount of power you simply swipe your fingers left or right over the controls and it’s very responsive and controllable which we really like. The timer is a really useful feature meaning you can get on with other tasks without worrying that food will overcook. It’s pretty quiet in comparison, although by the nature of the technology you will always hear some whirring particularly when using on full power. Its easy to keep clean too. A solid induction hob.",Approved

"We have always cooked with gas before, so when we moved to an area without mains gas we realised we would have to change to an electric hob. Our main concern was how controllable it would be, and how the hob would look after it had been used for a while - all the electric hobs we had seen became obviously scratched from cleaning. We chose an AEG induction hob, and realised our concerns were groundless. In fact we would never go back to gas cooking now - induction hobs are so much quicker and more controllable, and also much cleaner. We realised that the scratched hobs we had seen were ceramic hobs which become very hot and bake food onto their surface, making them difficult to clean off. Induction hobs heat only the pan itself, so they only get as hot as the pan does. This also makes them much safer. 

This particular hob is really quick - heats water much faster than our electric kettle for instance - but is also really controllable. We are now able to simmer things for a long time on the top of the stove without them sticking to the pan - something that gas cooking never allowed. We really like the 14 different heat settings, because you quickly get to know what setting is needed for different pans and contents - so no more rice water boiling over! The timer function for each heating area works really well and is simple to use.

We have an AEG hood which enables us to use the Hob2Hood function which works really well. Unfortunately the hood itself is poorly designed and functions poorly, although it looks very attractive.  That however may be the subject of a separate review, and in no way detracts from this excellent hob.",Approved
Changed from a gas hob to this induction hob. What a difference! So many great features and instant control. Would recommend this hob to everyone.,Approved
"Extremely pleased with my new induction hob - after going out and buying myself some new pans, I found it very easy to operate, so efficient and timesaving.  I like the way it tells me that I’ve put something on it that shouldn’t be there (even foil) - it will beep at me.  It is so fast to heat things up - had a few mishaps at first getting to grips with the speed and the temperature operation but in no time I got the hang of it.  It is a lot different than a conventional hob, but so much fun to use due to the speed and efficiency.  Its also very stylish, sleek and easy to keep clean.   I would highly recommend this hob to anyone, whether you’re fond of cooking like me, or not.  I didn’t get to test the Hob2Hood function as I don’t have a hood.",Approved
"this is a good quality machine, have had zanussi before and always reliable. good features are easy clean dispenser tray, easy acces to filter and most programmes can use a quick cycle.
Room for improvement on getting powder into dispenser tray, door a bit hard to close sometimes.
Overall a good machine as usually only need a short wash as only 2 people at home now so doing a quick wash is ideal for less washing.
Would recommend this product",Approved
"I have had my induction hob for a week now and I love it.  I was a bit nervous about switching to induction as I was worried the heat wouldn't be instant and that it would be more like using an electric hob than a gas hob.  I really didn’t need to worry, it’s so powerful and the heat increases/decreases instantly.

The hob is really attractive and  is touch control so you just glide you finger over the heat setting to set temperature.  It’s also really easy to clean as just a flat piece of glass, which is a big improvement on my previous gas hob.

It has a heat range of 1 - 14 plus a power boost option.  It has taken me a few days to get use to this heat range and what works best for the dishes I’m cooking but I now have it mastered.  I was quite surprised at how fast it boils water,  If you set temperature to high and press the power boost function  it boils water as quick as the kettle.  I always use to boil water for pasta etc in the kettle as it was quicker but I now just do it all on the hob. 

I find the timer function brilliant as you can set the timer and once the time is up, the hob will switch off automatically.   I have a bad habit of boiling the water dry everytime I cook boiled eggs, so this works really well for me.  

The hob also has a pause function which allows you to pause cooking if you need to walk away from hob.  It holds all the heat settings for each ring and then just continues to cook at those settings once you return. 

Another great feature of this hob is the cooking zones.  The hob can be used as four zones like a normal hob or it adapts to the size of the pan so if you want to use a large pan that is usually too large for the ring this can be placed across two cooking zones.

The hob does have a hob to hood function, so the hood automatically switches on when using the hob. This sounds great but unfortunately I don’t have right hood so I’ve not been able to try this out.

I would definitely recommend this hob, its looks great, easy to use, some useful features and is very powerful.",Approved

"We have just refurbished our Kitchen and whilst working with our builder and planning the kitchen he recommended we choose AEG or NEFF appliances as in his experience that provided a great balance of costs vs quality. We inherited the appliances installed in out old kitchen when we moved into the house and they we pretty basic and old Hotpoint appliances. We visited a few electrical retailers and looked around before deciding on AEG for both our new Oven and Hob.
 Our kitchen design was pretty modern in style with Grey Gloss Handless doors and Quartz worktops and our design gave us enough space for an 80CM Induction hob. 

Once installed the super glossy black Glass hob looks great set into the worktop and compliments the modern look of the kitchen very well. Once installed the first thing we decided to do was boil a small pan of water as we only had 1 pan that worked with Induction at this point. We put the pan on the hob and set it on maximum, The touch controls are great and very sensitive to the touch, its nothing like touch panels from years ago where you were never sure you had activated it or not. About 55 seconds later we had water bubbling in the pan which was amazing and much faster than our kettle. 

We haven't done that much cooking yet but what we have done has been a pleasure. One thing I read is that Induction is more difficult to control the temp than gas, it’s not more difficult just different but you easily get used to it. 
The other thing I read is that because of the magic of induction and the way it heats the food stuff doesn't get baked onto your pans so cleaning is easier. I can't be 100% sure and maybe its because we also bought new pans but they do seem to clean up easier. 

The only downside I can think of is that dust shows up easily on gloss black so I found myself dusting it often. 
Second and something that I hope will be a longterm thing is I wonder will the glass mark or scratch overtime? 

However overall I’m super happy with my AEG hob purchase.",Rejected

"Whilst recently renovating a kitchen, we found that we were unable to have a gas connection and so opted for an AEG Induction Hob. Having previously used only gas or ceramic hobs, the difference between the former and induction are light years apart; I just wished I had switched to induction years ago! 

This induction hob provides the same level of instant heat as gas, whilst being a fraction of the effort to clean.  This particular model packs a host of safety features including a child lock, residual heat indicators and an auto-cut out function should a pan over-boil. The hob itself is extremely smart looking, intuitive to use and very responsive to level changes.  We are slowly in the process of replacing old Neff/Siemens product and we have found AEG to provide excellent quality and value at the same time. The customer service provided by AEG has been exceptional. Highly recommend.",Approved

"Recently upgraded to an induction hob. After hesistations about changing from gas to induction I didn't need to worry. So far I love it. It looks very sleek and is very easy to clean. I love that you can wipe up spills straight away because the only area that gets hot is the area immediately under a pan. 

The cooking area is 2 large surfaces rather than individual ring areas. This means it is easy to use several pans of different sizes as the cooking area adapts to the different pan sizes and the pan doesn't have to fit within a certain size ring. 
The heat up time is really quick especially using the powerboost function. Water starts boiling within seconds. An extra large pan can be boiling in under 3 minutes.  

I also like the fact that as soon as you remove a pan the surface you were heating it on cuts out immediately. 

It's quite early days using my hob but so far I am very impressed and would recommend it.",Approved
"This is a very good hob, the induction heating gives a very short heat up time and quick response without an annoying lag. The temperature is very controllable.

I've been very impressed so far with my hob. This us the first time I've ever used an induction hob and after my first initial apprehension I've quickly got to grips with it and I'm really impressed with how responsive it is. And it's so easy to keep clean!!!,Approved
"I previously had an electric ceramic hob as we live in an area without a local gas supply.  It took an age to heat up and there was little immediate control when changing temperature.  We decided to look at an induction hob based on a recommendation from a friend who works as a professional chef.

We decided to opt for the IKE64450FB as it was the right power rating and also there was a bridging function on each of the left and right induction areas.

The power control is crisp and enables boiling pans to be brought to a simmer in a second or so.  The ""P"" power/pulse setting is great at boosting the heating speed, and is especially useful to bring the pan unto the maximum temperature in a very short period of time.  It's so good that I've stopped using the kettle to heat water to boil pasta.  All you hear is a faint buzzing sound when you set the power on this ""P"" setting.  The bridging function is especially useful when you have larger pans, for example when I'm cooking a family risotto, and it's simple to link the hobs with a simple touch of a button.  The timer function is of limited value as I use a separate kitchen timer, but it works and I'm sure will be useful for some.  The controls are easy to use and sensitive enough to change when needed.  One of the great attractions to induction hobs is the fact they don't retain the excess heat when you remove the pan from the hob, which certainly gives me piece of mind when my young family is in the kitchen.

Overall the IKE64450FB is a great hob and I would certainly recommend it for those looking at getting a new induction hob.",Approved

"We had the hob installed as part of a full kitchen. It does what it's supposed to, and the heating area is very flexible.
However after only a few uses of the centre area, we noticed a grey spiral pattern below the surface.

As this was our first induction hob, we were not sure what it was and were concerned. We had not noticed anything like it on other more used heating areas.

First we rang the AEG helpline, but the 'agent' was not listening to us and eventually just cut us off.

Then, twice I contacted AEG through their website, asking whether his was normal. I have registered all the appliances, so it was done through 'My AEG'.

Several weeks later, I've still not had a reply.

Incidentally, the grey spiral ring has gone, so I'm assuming it was normal.

This was one of seven AEG appliances in our kitchen, I had hoped at least for a courtesy email back!",Rejected

Ok on convection but microwave continued to be a problem with uneven cooking despite religiously following cooking instructions. Annoyingly the internal light kept on fusing out every few weeks.

To their credit AEG have now replaced the unit following a second engineer visit but alas there has been no improvement in the performance of the microwave function - we continue to experience uneven cooking - very disappointing for an oven that costs over £700.

Think very carefully before you buy, after 30 years of AEG products though out the house I'm extremely disappointed in what seems to be a basic design flaw.",Rejected

It does a large wash load with several spin options. Easy to operate without referring to instructions. Not tried the dryer yet so can't comment. Expensive compared to other machines but this was our only option due to our door! Registered by phone to get extra warranty but really it was just to make you buy extra insurance. Did also register on line and got £50 cashback even though I wasn't aware of it. Fitting instructions would have been more useful at the beginning of the manual as I ended up searching on line. Overall I'm happy with the machine. Seems well built and does a good size load. If there had been a choice, I probably would have opted for a different machine offering a short fast wash but I'll cope with an hour 'short' cotton wash.

"I have had my new AEG washing machine for about 3 weeks. So far I am pleased with it. It has a very useful big door which makes it so much easier to load. The programme options are self explanatory and easy to use. My one gripe here is that whilst I am still getting accustomed to the machine I need to wear my glasses to read the options as, although on the front of the machine and large enough lettering, the lettering is a little pale. It could be more distinct. The quick and super quick options are good news as otherwise some of the programmes would be quite lengthy. I do find the spinner at 1200 and 1400 a little disappointing, but it seems that all machines nowadays seem to suffer this. I have an old Zanussi in my holiday home and it's top speed is 800 and this spins as dry as the 1200 on this new AEG and my on previous machine. I also find that in some instances, not all, the machine vibrates when spinning. I don't find the machine especially quiet, but it certainly isn't any noisier than any other machine I've had. I also find it difficult to use the dispenser. My machine is located under a counter top with a fitted door. This was custom built for a machine 2 machines ago, but the previous machine and this new one have slightly different front dimensions which means the dispenser does not protrude far enough from under the work top. So a nuisance, although strictly speaking not the fault of the machine, rather the fault of designers not standardising their measurements even within the same manufacturer. I also find the dispenser draw very awkward to remove for cleaning. This definitely could be improved upon. However, overall, I am very pleased with my new machine.",Approved

However I feel that the soap dispenser tray is quite flimsy and the plastic could break up after a couple of years, I’m also not too keen on the digital programme selector as you have to use it slowly or you go past the programme you want and end up going through the whole list again. - my old washer had a good old fashioned knob which worked really well and you could just turn it to the required programme. I would definitely recommend this machine but sometime so called progress isn’t always the best way forward.",Approved
"First of all I'm happy how quiet wash machine are working , my downstairs neighbours think happy as well )) Good choise of programmes , easy manage.",Approved
Representing good value this is a machine that does everything a normal household requires. It is very quiet and has a good range of programmes. It appears to be well built and is very compact for a washer dryer. I am very pleased with our purchase.,Approved
Does what it needs to do. Great value & would recommend.,Approved
"Initially had difficulty with the right settings, seemed too long for some items. Got used to the machine now. Very quiet compared with my old machine. Also 5 year guarantee is good.",Approved
"Good at collecting debris from wooden floor, picks up surface debris from carpet but will never be as good or powerful as a proper mains hoover and doesn't lift the pile very much. Its highly portable, good for stairs and a lovely attachment for brushing upholstery. The collection box isn't big compared to a mains machine so needs emptying really every time its used. A handy cleaner for a quick once-over and quite versatile.",Approved
"Silent, efficient, compact and reliable this washing machine is great.",Approved
"I purchased this machine as my previous one was Zanussi and I thought it a good make. The first thing that bothered me about this machine was the 4 hour long cotton wash. If you use the quick button you can reduce this to 3.5 hours. To overcome the length of the cycle I had to use the timer. Unfortunately after doing a few cotton washed I discovered my clothes are getting destroyed. All my cotton items have bobbled beyond repair and all cuffs and collars have become misshapen. It has ruined 2 school uniforms. 
The manual does not give any information on the time of each cycle, you have no idea when it is going to end. 
Do not purchase this machine, it wrecks the clothes .",Approved
"I really enjoy using cz7, it's so light and easy to use. Love the hand held attachment. It is great quality and well designed. I had a cylinder cleaner before, and this has definitely converted me. No more wire's trapped under the doors.. Would definitely recommend this hoover :-)",Approved
This is my first ever AEG product and I have to say so far am very impressed. The features are great and so easy to use. The touch panel is a very nice touch and the time until finished is very handy. This is my first washer with these touches (had a hoover before this lasted 17 years ) so I have very high expectorations of this product. The one big plus is how quiet the machine is the water going in is more noisy than the actual spinning and washing. I would recommend this product no problem.,Approved
The longest wash times of any machine I have ever had. The standard cotton at 60 degrees takes a staggering 244 minutes! Even the wool/handwash programme is 75 minutes long. Very disappointed and wish I had not chosen this particular machine. DO NOT BUY unless you dont mind spending days on end waiting for wash to finish.....,Approved

"My last Zanussi wash machine was outstanding. It had a timer so i could see how long every wash was. This machine has no timer and every wash even on quick wash so far has taken over 3 hours. I do a lot of my washing at the weekends and because of the duration of the washes i had the machine on all day.. if you want a quick wash you need to use the 30.-30. function which may take 30 mins but at 30 degrees and that time length that will not wash a normal wash of clothes.. There is nothing even in between. I only own the machine a week, i doubt it can be returned to the shop?? I cannot stick it..",Approved

"This really is, in my opinion, the best machine around. outstandingly quiet with useful features...

Very fast spin (with a big drum spinning so fast clothes are almost dry!). 

The water softener does seem to make a difference. (I did think it might be a gimmick). Clothes feel really soft. 

Steam is a feature I never thought I would use but it really does what it says. I recently went on holiday and managed to crumple clothes but not wear them. Into the machine.... nearly Perfect!

For a complex machine it is not complicated! a simple choice of adjustable programmes makes it easy to use, especially with a very 'easy to read in all light conditions' logical display.

Very light on electricity too. I use the delay start and nearly always use just solar energy!

Niggles... (hence 4 out of 5 for features)

A useful light in the drum comes on when you load but , sadly, it doesn't come on if you don't empty the machine immediately after the cycle finishes. (You have to press the machine on again otherwise that black sock remains hidden in the drum!)

One quite annoying let down is the fact that although the machine weighs the clothes you have to close the door and let the machine run for 30 seconds before it simply tells you whether you have exceeded the recommended weight. My old AEG told me the weight as I put the washing in which enabled me to maximise all loads easily. 

Don't let this put you off. It is a great machine overall",Approved
"Delay start allows washing to be done with off peak electricity and its nice to be ready to hang out first thing in the morning. Pity it does not come with a little person to do this

I love love love the time clock that shows how long till the cycle finishes. All those years of trying to estimate waiting for the cycle to finish!! I really love the quick refresh cycles for when something isn't actually dirty but just needs a quick refresh wash. As we now have smaller mixed washes the reduced drum size is perfect. We also have a small space for a machine and this one fitted with room to spare.
I honestly cannot fault it",Approved

"This machine was an insurance replacement for my last AEG which was repaired significantly in the 7.5 years I had it. Last time being a full re-build which lasted 18 months and being faced with another re-build D&G decided to write it off. 
I didn't have a great choice in my replacement (without spending extra money) so this was the latest nearest equivalent to my old one in terms of specification and price. 
So far it has washed beautifully without too much fuss. My main criticism is if you use the ""standard cycles"" they are 3.5 - 4.5 hours long!!! I hasten to add that 99% of my loads are done using the ""time save"" feature which reduces the time to around 1.25 - 1.5 hours which is on par with my old machine. I do find that the full cycles are great for the dogs bedding, it actually come out smelling clean with no hint of doggy.
The ""beep"" to let you know it has finished is much quieter and not as prominent as my old machine and when its finished and ""beeped"" it instantly turns itself off to save energy....this is a good feature but sometimes I haven't realised its finished (because I haven't heard the beep) and when I go to retrieve the washing its creased. 
All in all I am pleased with the appliance and hope it performs better than its predecessor.",Approved

This cooker is great and unlike my previous fan oven it doesn't burn food. There are lots of different settings for the oven but to be honest I just seem to stick to one.

"From the delivery, things went downhill fast. Tried to get the machine level, but 3 of the feet were broken; just kept spinning around and around, would not adjust at all. 

Tried it out anyway, the thing was jumping around like a crazy horse getting broken in. Phoned John Lewis, who were helpful, put me through to AEG who transferred me to the local engineers. 

A week later the engineer turned up, only 1 replacement foot. I told them 3 of the feet were broken! Needless to say, couldn’t use the machine. 9 days later another guy came out. Replaced the broken parts, tested the machine, still jumping around but not so bad. Said he’d return with “dampners” as the noise during spin was the loudest from any machine we’ve had, and we’ve had a few over the past 30 years.

One of the main reasons for buying this was the “how quiet it is” reviews. So we waited in all the Friday, no one showed up. Phoned them again, told we’d have to wait a further 9 days as “the job wasn’t on the route”. Dundee is not the middle of nowhere! When the 3rd engineer came out, no “dampners”, just a tool bag. Tested the machine for a while, then claimed it must be our floor. Considering that was the 3rd machine to sit on that spot and the only one to be jumping around, obviously it is not the floor but the machine.

Anyway, some 6 months later, the machine still jumps around, needs pushed back into place every so often! It’s only on the spin when there’s a problem, otherwise it is fairly quiet, but the spin noise level averages 93dbs. Far from the advertised spin level 75dbs.

Latest problem is with the spin, on certain cycles it's just not doing it's job and so we have to re-spin them. Which reminds me, if you do not have a full load, the spin is next to useless.

Based on our experience of the machine and after sales care, I can not recommend this piece of junk to anyone. The quicker it complete crumbles into the ground the better.",Rejected
"We are getting on a bit so digital can be challenging. We chose digital controls as we had problems operating the knobs on our previous appliance due, partly,  to dodgy fingers !  It is a challenge to learn anew but overall we have not been beaten and are happy with the oven!   It looks very good in the new kitchen. Another reviewer said she could not use the two ovens simultaneously but I did so recently. I'm assuming she is reviewing the same appliance as me.",Approved
"When our 10 year old Zanussi ZWF1200 finally started to slow down there was never any question of which to choose..definitely Zanussi!!
Our new one is excellent.efficient, flexible, economic programmes, some taking only 20 mins on a cold/cool wash using the quick wash feature,which is excellent for speed & economy in these energy expensive times.Result very good on lightly soiled items.Longer washes also available for heavier soiling can also be reduced in time by the Quick Wash if needed.Variety of spin speeds, Rinse Hold excellent & very quiet spin.Time delay really good from 30 mins up to 20 hours, just what we wanted for economy overnight use.VERY HAPPY",Approved

"We decided to take advantage of the post Christmas sales offers and replace our Bosch Classix washing machine with a new AEG L6FBI841N. The Bosch had given us 18 years of good service but having replaced the shock absorbers just four months back it made sense to make the change before our old machine was totally worn out.
Of course, the decision to change brands to AEG was made much easier for us after having replaced our (recalled) Hotpoint tumble dryer with a brilliant new AEG T65170A. That tumble dryer really impressed us both.
Our new washing machine is rated as A+++ and also features a 20 minute wash cycle so the ongoing reduction in running costs (electricity – water – detergent) over the next 20 years means the machine will by far more than justify the higher purchase price compared with most other makes. Lucky for us the price had been seriously reduced in the sales, so the total costs over the machines expected lifetime make the AEG the cheaper option in the long run.
.
The machine was delivered when expected and was very easy to install by myself. This took less than half an hour.
.
I could not believe it when I set it to do it's first (empty) wash and spin. It was virtually silent.
.
We have been using our new machine for over two weeks now, and remain seriously impressed with both the ease of use and also the speed and quality of the wash done. With a load capacity of 8kg and spin speed of 1400 rpm this is definitely the best washing machine we have ever owned.",Approved

It is simple to use, with 1 dial control for programmes, straightforward adjustments can be made to your choice of programme, such as 'light soiling' which automatically halves the wash time (or increase time with 'heavy soil') using separate buttons.
It takes a big load (9kg), but can also cope with smaller loads by using the 'light' option. Illuminated countdown timer also very useful, as is the handwash programme.",Approved

"Dear Sir/Madam,
I am writing to complain about your AEG treatment towards the customers.
We purchased a washing machine AEG washing machine series 6000 (L6FBI841N) from AO online company, following a successful delivery we tried for the first time on (7/8/17) but unsuccessfully. The machine went through the whole program but didn't spin.
We phoned AO's number, after a long wait through a myriad of telephone options we finally spoke to someone. We explained the problem, we also explained that we tried different programs still unsuccessful, the guy mentioned that was going to put us on hold and talk to manufacture (YOU), after a long wait he came back suggesting we should get in touch with the manufacture and book an engineer. We asked him to make an appointment for us, he said that we should do ourselves and pass on the call to an AEG telephone operator. Again, we went through the process explaining the problem, the operator (female staff) mentioned that because we are in middle of summer holidays, no engineer were available until Tuesday 15th of August the earliest, we mentioned that we were in need for the washing machine we couldn't wait that long but, to no avail. 
To summarise the problem:
• Purchased AEG series 6000 (L6FBI841N) from AO online company on 1/8/17
• Delivered on Sunday 6/8/17
• Operated several times on Monday 7/8/17 washing machine no spinning
• Engineer to attend on 15/8/17
This problem should never occured in the first place, we bought AEG beliving they make good products. How wrong we were! ! !
We were dissapointed to be pass on from one telephone operator to another, what we needed was someone with a technical knowledge to ask few questions and hopefully to come back and suggest the solution. We should never had to spend more than 45 minutes on the phone to deal with the problem in the end to be told by AEG operator we have to wait until next Tuesday for an engineer to turn up.
We are very unhappy for the service received, we pensioners deserve better treatment and better service then this. 
Please pass on this e-mail to your company executive or managing director.

The machine looks good and works really well. I had no trouble installing it and the instructions are really easy to follow. It has plenty of choices when it comes to programmes and the 20 minute one is extremely useful. The clothes are coming out really clean and the 1200 spin speed means they also come out quite dry.

"Features are good but cannot use any of the shorter cycles because the clothes do not wash. Only the full cycles (which are at least 3 hours long) will clean the clothes. It isn't the quietest either and I am not sure the drum really has an 8kg capacity. It is significantly smaller than my old Hotpoint (and cleaning is worse and is much noisier).

"I love this cooker. One small complaint and this is personal to me is the gas hob trivets are too big for the sink. I am used to 4 single trivets, easily soaked in the sink, rinsed , dried and replaced. The two large long trivets have to be manhandled and turned to soak and clean. Having said that, they usually wipe clean very easily, just personally like to soak and clean after a greasy cook.",Approved

"We already had an AEG washer dryer and have had the same one for 13 years.The handle became broken and due to its age decided on a replacement. So what did we find with the new model? Dramatic improvements design, style and efficiency.Being like kids with a new toy then we tried out most of the programmes within days to find that the machine performed equally as well on each, and every setting.A most impressive machine then with no faults to speak of as yet except perhaps that the spin speed of the one hour programme could be increased from 1200 to 1600. We can not find out as yet if this can be done so will write to customers services.Glad we 'got the same' type of machine again? yes, indeed we are.A first-class machine that performs very well and should last for years.",Approved

"This machine is advertised as having an 'inverter' motor and the 'washer dryer operates exceptionally quietly' Not so the dryer side!
I have only given 2 stars to this lovely machine due, in my opinion, to a serious design oversight. All the time the dryer is running the pump motor makes a very annoying and intrusive regular noise from the scavenger pump running all the time as it tries to remove water from the system. I understand how the condensing dryer system works but cannot understand why it is necessary for this pump to continue unabated. There must be a very small amount of water removed from the laundry as it is dried and if it really is necessary for such a noisy pump to be activated I would have thought it could be programmed to operate every 15 minutes or so - not for the whole 1 - 2 hours of the drying cycle.
Needless to say I am very sorry to have spent nearly £700 on a machine which is noisier than our old AEG of some 9 years.
The washing side of the machine is excellent but seriously flawed by the dryer noise.
Would I recommend this machine? Yes - but with a proviso that consideration should be given to the washer/dryer being sited out of the house - perhaps garage or utility room.",Rejected

I bought this machine based on reviews highlighting its quietness. I'm therefore very disappointed that although the spin is very quiet there is a constant loud booming noise whilst draining and throughout a drying cycle. The drain pump unit appears to be the problem. As this machine is only one day old I do not know if this is a fault on the machine or a design feature. I contacted AEG and was advised that they could send out an engineer but that if it turned out not to be a fault I would have to pay for the call out. As I have already paid a lot for the machine I do not want to incur additional cost. I would have thought AEG could have been able to advise if the noise is normal. If it is then I definitely would not recommend anyone buying this machine.,Rejected

"This was a great buy when we had twins - constant washing going on! The display shows how long each cycle takes, which is really useful for planning when to put it on, but I've yet to run a cycle that actually takes as long as advertised!
The machine is clever enough to sense the weight of the load and if you put a smallish load on, it often cuts a chunk off the time after it's been going for a few minutes, so in that sense it's energy saving. This works well with the washing function, but the drying function is a different story!
Again, it senses the size of the load, and the amount of water still in the items, so it tries to adjust the time accordingly, however, it often underestimates hugely. Just today for example, I put on a mid size load of synthetics to dry, a 3hr 1min programme. After 20 minutes or so, the timer showed 1hr 30mins, yet 4 and a half hours later, the machine is still going! In a good way, it will not finish the programme until the load is completely dry, but, having counted down the 1hr 30mins, it showed 1 minute on the timer for the next 2 hours! I wouldn't mind if it adjusted the time back up, but it counts down, and then just stays there. Do I go out, or wait for it? Do I go to bed, or wait for it?!
Additionally, when drying cottons on a high heat, if you don't open the door soon after the end of the cycle, the 'heat' inside the drum condenses and makes the load feel slightly damp when you remove it, so you have to air it out quickly before you put it away.
I like the machine, and it does the job, and other machines I have had have also had issues with counting, so I expect it's fairly standard. Just annoying!",Approved

"The machine has had two weeks active use so far and seems to be performing to expectations. What isn't is AEG's very poor customer service. I have now written four times in an attempt to register for my 5 year guarantee but no one has confirmed I am registered and I have the extended guarantee. The most surprising response was after my third message when the ""customer care"" team said they didn't deal with such queries and I should contact another department. What can't they pass it on internally and care about their customers? Looks like lots of stovepipes exist at AEG, but I will struggle on to try and obtain this.",Rejected
"I was given this machine from AEG to use and give an open and honest review, so here goes...

I have previously used AEG products so I am aware that they are of a high quality spec and I wasn't disappointed this time. We have used the machine more or less every other day for the past 2 weeks and it is exceptionally easy to use which isn't something I would say unless I was being completely honest.

I love the fact there is a digital display so you know exactly how long each function can take and it also displays what part of the cycle is taking place. This has been great as I can plan my day and know exactly how many washes I can do in the day before the clouds come out. 

As a mother of 3 young kids, we have mainly used the 48min super economic cycle as their clothes are changed daily but are not incredibly dirty. The output of the clean clothes is great and they look nice and fresh. What amazed me the most was how quiet the machine was up until the spin at the end obviously. I actually had to go and check a few times that it was still on. Also the buzzer at the end was very useful as having a noisey and hectic household means I usually forget the machine has finished. My clever husband managed to find an additional 12 min spin/drain function without even using the manual which meant the clothes came out a lot dryer and we didn't have to rely too much on the few hours of sun we have to dry the clothes on the washing line.

I also tried the 20 min 3kg cycle which was useful for washing the bathroom mats and tea towels in separate washes as I didn't want to mix them with the other laundry and still feel happy about the fact I hadn't wasted too much energy and water.

What impressed me was that apart from being able to control the temperature and spin as well as delaying the start so the clothes are washed overnight and a time save function, which I'm used to with other machines, this machine had lots of functions I wasn't aware of before like an 'anti crease' and 'refresh' function as well as one just for jeans and duvets, how amazing is that! 

Before I try to think of any cons with the machine, I can honestly say that the pros would definitely outweigh the negatives even though I have only used the machine for a limited time and have a lot more exploring to do.

As everything isnt perfect, the only cons for me were the fact that I did manage to use the refresh function for some damp smelling baby clothes, and I expected the clothes to come out a bit more fresher but that maybe my personal opinion and they definitely did smell slightly better. Also if I was to ever choose another AEG again then i would probably go for a bigger drum like a 9kg because having a few children means lots of laundry to do and no time for tea. So anything to save time is great.

Overall I am exceptionally pleased to product test this machine and I have no hesitation in recommending it anyone. Hopefully you won't be disappointed!",Approved
"I am thrilled with this product rating it 10 out of 10. If I could give it more I would. My washing is visibly whiter, brighter and softer to the touch . I have wanted an AEG for some time and just wish I had bitten the bullet years ago. It's SO quiet I have to check it's still working! My laundry looks and feels like new , so much so that even the ironing is less of a chore. The large capacity drum makes light work of bed quilts, pillows and other bulky items. This is the best machine I have ever owned and cannot rate it high enough. A thoroughly satisfied customer.",Approved
"This machine replaced an old Bosch 1200 spin. The drum is bigger and I feel that the clothes are fresher and cleaner after a wash. The different types of cycles are good. I do find that
the majority of the cycles don’t spin at full 1600. So I put an extra spin on to keep drying time down. Have not used the steam function yet. Really nice look to the machine. I also like how quick it unlocks once the washing has finished. Having a direct drive is a bonus. I am looking forward to using this machine for many years. May even get a new tumble dryer from AEG to match.",Approved

"This is a 9kg Protex drum 1600rpm washer dryer
Meaning i can do one was instead of 2 due to its larger drum , which is great for someone like me who does 2-3 washes a day,
The large Soft Drum gently washes your clothes, while OptiSense technology uses intelligent sensors to adapt settings for each load, optimising performance. meaning it weighs the clothes once the machine starts so t knows how long it will need to wash them
There is a number of functions on this machine It has an excellent wool/silk wash which delicately washes those jumper and shirts you would normally have to hand wash, they really do come out perfect no shrinkage or out of shape jumpers ,

"I was selected by the manufacturer to receive a free product in return for an honest review. I received the AEG Washer Dryer L77695WD which replaced my 2 year old Samsung ecobubble™ Washing Machine. It’s the first washer dryer I’ve used in over 5 years, I’ve always had concerns that you compromise on the performance of a combined machine and end up not using most the functionality, buy now I’m totally convinced that’s not the case.

Capacity - one of my previous gripes with washer dryers is the capacity when moving from washing to drying and often having to take half the load out to use the dryer effectively. AEG solved this by having a 6kg capacity for the dryer – and not to forget the massive 9kg for washing! However I was still apprehensive and the first time I washed my super king-size bedding I took half the load out before using the dryer. However after actually understanding just how much 6kg means in terms of laundry, I realised that I could easily wash and dry all the bedding and have done since and it usually dries with 1.5-2 hours which is so convenient.

Features - there are plenty of options when selecting your wash dry cycle. You have to play around to find out what the right wash is for tor everyday load, I found the quick cycle didn't spin for long enough but I've now found my perfect combination. The sensor drying is great, three options on how dry you want your laundry and it comes out perfectly dried every time. The only annoying thing with a washer dryer is that as there is no fluff filter, it collects around the door and needs wiping out before doing your next wash otherwise everything gets covered in fluff – made that mistake with some new towels!

Wool wash and dry – I’ve done a separate section on this because it really is that good. With my last washing machine and every one before it, my wool jumpers would come out of the washing machine tangled and misshapen and I would have to stretch into shape before air drying. With the AEG’s wool wash cycle, my jumpers came out looking perfect and like new.",Approved

"I own the predecessor to this appliance – the Zanussi ZRB32313WA

I initially bought this fridge, back in September 2013, because of the limited width my kitchen has available.
At 59.5cm wide, it really does ‘just’ fit into the space. (A 60cm wide fridge would be scratched if forced into the space.)

When I first started to search for a fridge-freezer, I was concerned that I would be limited to a few options, of basic machine with awful specifications and possibly cheap quality.
During my search, I found the Zanussi range offered this perfect width, but was also a high-spec’ machine (with a high energy rating of A+) but was also generous with internal space. It wasn’t cheap either at £419.99 I was buying something better than average.

I found that various sellers actually sell this same machine under variations of the same model number – the differences between each ‘version’ was as simple as the graphics stuck on the drawers, or how many plastic shelves are supplied for the fridge compartment.

The machine was bought locally from a Euronics store and was specially ordered in. It was delivered a few days later. It fitted perfectly into that 59.5cm space I had for it.
Perfect. When it use it made those ‘common’ fridge-freezer sounds, like bussing and the occasional crack. (At first these were alarming but there was a guide with the instructions that cleverly demonstrate the various noises the machine will make.)

I found the internal space fantastic for my needs:
For the fridge, a couple of bottles of wine in the rack, plenty of door shelving for my fruit juice, dairy items, and the two drawers fine for my vegetables. The rest of the trays held various other things like jams and chutneys.
For the freezer, the three drawers were great for storing meat and stock. For a single person, I could easily store a month’s work of meat and frozen veg.

Then after 7 months of use, in April 2014, the machine stopped working. I went away to a relatives on Friday night and returned on the Sunday to find the machine silent.
I opened the fridge to find it warm, and smelly – food was rotting. I opened the freezer to find it barely cold, and the meat had thawed out. All that food had to be thrown out. I wasn’t happy. I contacted the seller, who passed me onto Zanussi.
The machine has a 12-month warranty, and so an engineer came out a couple of days later. He repaired the machine within about an hour, and essentially ‘re-gassed’ the appliance. A few hours later it was all back up and running, and I could get about re-stocking it with food. All was fine.

It turned one year old in September 2014, and so the warranty expired.

At the end of November 2014, at 14 months old, I returned from a couple of nights away. It was Sunday afternoon and I returned to find machine has stopped working again. This is 7 month after the initial repair. I wasn’t happy, and also very aware that the warranty had expired.
As with the first failure, the machine was silent. Once again, the fridge was warm (warmer than the actual kitchen) and stinky. And once again, the freezer was full of thawed meat, and warm, too. And once again I threw away a lot of spoiled food.

I contacted Zanussi on the Monday morning. During that day, I made three phone-calls (each lasting around 30 minutes). I explained the problem, and was advised that an out-of-warranty service would be £115. I refused to pay this given the age of the machine, and the fact it had already failed once before. I asked to speak to someone about a replacement machine, and was advised I’d be called back. This happened for the first two phone-calls – as nobody returned my call.
The third call was pretty much the same, expect this time it was 5.15pm and most of the office had left for the day. I was given the Customer Care email address and advised to write in.

So, that Monday evening I emailed the Zanussi/Electrolux Customer Care department and explained exactly what had happened. I also sent this email to my local Euronics store as well as the main Euronics customer service email.

A week has no passed, and it’s early December (writing this review on 6th December).
In that time I have not had any response from Zanussi, nothing from Euronics, and one call from my local Euronics store that have supposedly contacted Zanussi themselves. I even contacted Zanussi UK via Facebook and Twitter, who have simply passed my contact details to the Customer care team.

Having spent over £400 on an appliance, I would expect it to last well beyond 14 months. (My previous fridge-freezer was a Hotpoint, cost £400, and lasted me 3 years before I sold it with my flat to the new owner.)
I appreciate that machines do fail, and that is why we have warranty periods, but the value of the product also implies its quality. This machine hasn’t lived up to its retail value.
Also, given the age of the appliance, the customer should not be willing to pay out £115 to repair a fault that has occurred twice. In both cases I’ve been forced to throw away food that was never reimbursed, so why should I keep losing money for a faulty product?

The appalling level of customer service is simply unprofessional. I find it infuriating that customers can be treated this way – if I treated customers in this manner, I would be fired with immediate effect.

So, given my rant, do I recommend this machine? No.
Would I look at buying anything from Zanussi again? No.

Stay away from this product, and possibly any fridge-freezer produced by Zanussi, unless you really like throwing money away and receiving the worst possible customer experience.",Rejected

As I wear shirts for work every day, it was the steam function on this particular model that attracted me.

"On the day the supplier installed the new washing machine he left it switched on with no load on cotton setting. It took 4.5 hours for the wash to complete. There is no indication in the instructions booklet of such a duration for no load wash. Most people are likely to do no load wash on first installation. Please mention this in the instructions. Also in a subsequent 20min wash, we put in a small load of few items, fearful the wash may damage clothes, a natural reaction to be careful and try things, treat the machine with care. The wash was good but the machine vibrated profusely on spin. We though the worst that the machine was faulty until reading the trouble shooting section, where in mentions this happen on very small load or if it is a poorly installed machine. The user should be informed in the main text warning them of such vibration on low load not just in the trouble shooting, as it is an inherent machine design issue, no need to scare customer by panicking them, tell them up front what's likely to happen on a very small load, tell them this machine is designed for large loads and washing just few items is not recommended. Otherwise the washing machine has behaved and has worked fine, all washes that came out were clean and finished in the duration stated. However note a 20 min wash can go up to 40 min depending on how dirty the clothes were, as there is some sort of dirt monitor that extends the duration of wash, again this should be clearly stated in the instructions. Also a 20 min wash claim marking on the washing machine is incorrect and misleading, should read 'quick wash' as the wash duration is automatically adjusted by the machine.",Approved
I have had this extractor in use from end of July with infrequent use since. It looks stylish and provides a nice ambient light. Single fan offers limited 'suck' but higher levels provide good extraction.,Approved
I have not had time to use all the settings but I have found it easy to use,Approved
a good large machine when you have got used to its user set up and use,Approved
only thing holding filter up is strip of plastic. our broke on both sides . it now fall down everytime !,Approved
"Superb microwave oven, I especially like the simple things it does like the interior light turns off quickly when the door is left open, I also like the brightness of the interior when cooking, as I say simple things but brilliant.",Approved
"Great Item in both the quality and looks department, would for sure buy again.",Approved
The wash cycles are extremely flexible providing the ability to adjust temperature and duration at the same time. The spin cycle is so quiet - the quietest l’ve come across. I highly recommend it!,Approved
"We bought this last month and within 3 weeks of its operation , the machine stopped working. Engineer attend and told us the problem is main board and some cables. I have an old AEG machine and it is 20 years old and still going. To compare these together,new ones quality by far is less then the old one. It looks so cheap. For example, the cap plastic for pump filter is so thin and flimsy. Very disappointed with this one and unfortunately I didnt have a choice to replace this machine with another brand. Still waiting for that to get repaired.",Approved
"This washer replaced another (phone) brand double its price; lifted due to various faults. 
I was sceptical about AEG as I had never had an appliance from the previously- I wanted a washer with various functions but was easy enough for my 2 teenagers to use. I was also limited to dimensions due to a built in cupboard. 
Not only does the washer weigh the clothes and alters the time to save on water and electricity- it has an added steam function!
With a 1600 spin my clothes come out nearly dry, they smell absolutely fabulous! Everyone comments at what washing powder and softener I use
It looks stylish and modern, has wool wash, hand wash and other washes that I’ll never use!
Thank you AEG!",Approved
"I’m delighted with this machine. It has several wash programmes & even a steam setting. Also, it has an 8kg drum, which is really useful for large items. Will take a double duvet apparently.",Approved
"I don't normally leave reviews for products I've bought, however, I've had this washing machine for about 6 weeks now and felt I had to log in and review it as I've been so pleased!

The new washing machine has made life so much easier for my family and I. The ironing takes about half the time it used to with my old machine., genuinely can't believe how few creases there are when we take shirts out of the machine.

It's not the cheapest washing machine available but it's well worth the money considering the time it'll save you. A fantastic product.",Rejected
"The new AEG machine is easy to use and programme for a variety of washing times,temperatures, rinse and spin cycles.",Approved

"really love it, this cooks any food so well! the glass induction is easy to clean and the capacity is awesome!!",Approved
AEG washing machine is great if not a little complicated.,Approved
Easy to use as a practical appliance but costs on time and electricity.,Approved
"My first AEG, impressed with the quality and working of the machine. Machine automatically detects load and varies water and time depending on program set. Machine wash cycle is quiet and spin cycle is smooth, stable and very quiet at 1600 spin speed. Still trying out the various programs and features but to date very happy.",Approved
This is my second aeg washing machine and i love it . The big door makes loading so much easier. The dial and buttons are easy to use . And so far i have been able to create the kind of wash i want for my different types of washing i have. The cleanliness of the washing and condition the clothes come out of the machine is great. My washing is drying quicker. Also the machine is alot quiter. It was on a 1600 spin yesterday and i hardly notice it. I was going to go for a older aeg machine but notice this one was so much more efficient. Glad i spent a bit more .,Approved
Great product works well - we now have four AEG products in the kitchen and the bug bear with them all is poor instructions - don't know if this is translation or poor to begin with but there you go = doesn't take away from the product quality,Approved
Straight forward instructions made this an absolute charm to use. It is very quiet and there have been no issues to date. It cleans well and we would definitely recommend it tp anyone who asked us.,Approved
"We received our machine three weeks ago now, and I have to say my partner and I couldn't be happier with it. 

In the past we've always just bought washing machines at the bottom end, but given the slow but obvious damage being done to our clothes, we decided this was worth a try. Really glad to say, so far it's been worth every penny. 

The steam function is just brilliant. Lighter smart shirts barely need ironed, and heavier oxford cotton shirts now don't need ironed at all! So much time saved! 

The delicates function is great too. It took some bravery, but we tried dry-clean only tops and found them coming out perfect. So we're already saving cash on dry cleaning bills too. 

Honestly, can't recommend enough. The new tech has been great. Great washes, and time + money saved. Five star.",Approved
"Undoubtedly, so far the best washing machine we’ve bought. During operation it is extremely quiet, economical with a build quality which is clearly superior. I would have no hesitation in recommending this machine or indeed the manufacturer in general.",Approved
"Owned this for a few weeks and I've got to say I should it's the best decision I've made. The selection of programs suit almost everything I could use it for. Love the time save feature, and no noticeable difference in cleaning efficiency. The spin speed is great and it has shaved 15+ minutes off drying each lead of cottons. The machine is extremely quiet, and the maximum spin means you can still have a conversation at normal voice levels. The only negative I could find is the powder drawer. If you try to put the correct dosage of powder in for an 8kg load machine in you might struggle to get all the powder in section II, as the powder sections are very slim in design. We live in a hard water area and an 8kg machine usually needs 90-110ml of powder, which doesn't fit in the drawer in one go, so I usually throw the rest of the powder in the drum with the clothes. Overall this model suits our household perfectly.",Approved
This washing machine is the best that i have ever had. i really appreciate the following features: 20 min wash - fantastic! Reducing the time when the load is smaller - saves time and energy. Steam feature - fabulous. i would recommend this machine to anyone who asks.,Approved
"So far so good, the machine does everything the manufacturer said and does it well. It is very easy to use, all of the controls are very intuitive. I'm confident that the machine will give us the great service we had from our previous model. One of the highlights so far is the noise level, obviously as it is new you would expect it to be nice and quiet, but this really is low on noise.",Approved
"Great washing machine, looks great and fits lots, we have it in the laundry room and can’t hear it at all with the door closed. Would definitely recommend, although there is no half load button it weighs out washing and adjusts time / water which is amazing, only thing is there is quite a gap between the drum door and sealing so can suck up a baby sock or small item but did come back out before the wash finished",Approved
"I had aeg for many years, but over the last 5 years I have had 3 other brands. Happy to say I am back with the best of the best, lava mat all the way !! And with the new steam program, which by the way is brilliant, AEG are leading the way forward. The design and look are simply brilliant. WELL DONE AEG TEAM!",Approved
"Super product, but unfortunately the after sales customer service has been dreadful. I would not purchase an AEG product again. All our other kitchen appliance are NEFF who have been exceptional in their customer service",Rejected
Washes really well and is pretty quiet when on full spin compared to my older AEG which I had for more than 20 years. I hope I get as good service from this one,Approved
"I had this product since month ago , it has been great . I recommend The AEG beceuse this product still comes from Germany . I had great features . I believe AEG is the best .",Approved
"This machine has a large drum, is very quiet and stable, and has plenty of programmes. Many of these can be changed with touch controls by varying the temperature, spin speed and length of cycle.

I anticipate many years of trouble free operations for my machine.",Approved
"I would recommend this cooker,
It has great features easy to use and cooks beautifully.",Approved
"Nice solid build and works well. However, touch controls for the two ovens are over complicated and if you ""miss"" the setting you want, you have to cycle through all of the options again to get to the setting you want. With a bit more careful though on the control panel, could be perfect!",Approved
Very modern efficient cooker. looks good does what it says on the tin,Approved
"I absolutely love this fridge/freezer, I would definitely recommend, it is a little more expensive than others, but so worth it!",Approved
The induction hob provides the controllability of a gas hob with the ease of cleaning of a ceramic. Massive list of options for the ovens.,Approved
"I think the layout of the Fridge/Freezer is better than some. Two full size frezer drawers and one slightly smaller. The fridge capacity is great. A bottle rack would have been handy.
Good value on the whole but it is a very noisy model. You can hear it constantly throughout the day regardless of temperature setting set.",Approved
"Used it for only a few weeks, excellent results so far, only think the quick wash is too long",Approved
"Well ordered this model because it was the only one that fitted the integral space replacing a similar Zanussi one which had lasted just 8 years! Once fitted by the installers the freezer compartment immediately frosted over plus icicles despite being a frost free model. Eventually discovered the fitters had left a spacer tab on the door which had made the door seal fail
Today noticed the door compartment of the fridge has the holes for an additional bar to retain items. This was not supplied! Also the old model had a bottle rack at the top of the fridge. This model apparently doesn't have one or at least not supplied!!!",Approved
This product is very basic and has very limited features i.e. it has no short wash cycle only the normal for over 2 hours and its timer delay is fixed at only 3 hours leaving no option for the user. I have had far better AEG appliances; disappointing.,Approved
I have only begun to explore all the different programs available from my washing machine but it is very quiet and my clothes are washed really well and the 1400RPM maximum spin speed gets the clothes pretty dry. I have used the reduced DB (quiet) setting for washes at night so they can be spun the next morning and also the timesaver option. I love the separate compartment for the stain remover and the dispenser is very well thought out. I have not needed to use the tumble dryer much yet but for duvets and pillows it has been great and very easy to maintain. Both machines have huge capacity compared to my old 7kg drum washing machine and washer dryer where you could only dry around 3kgs of washing. Very pleased with the quality and functionality of both. Well done.,Approved
"Good overall. Hob not as quick as I would have expected. Grill, strange. There are two settings - centre and full. When on centre or full, the full grill is on.
Top oven great.
Generally a very good product.",Approved
Great machine. Only improvement would be if pump out & fast spin were quieter.,Approved
Very quiet and efficient ! The red in operation light and the green light when finished is a good feature,Approved
Very pleased with the frost free feature and the soft close doors are great as you can’t leave the doors open by mistake. The adjustable sliding shelves In the fridge door as very useful.,Approved
"This machine replaced a Hoover machine that had finally given up the ghost, and I was looking for something more upmarket. 

Having reviewed a number of different makes and models, I settled on this one because of the name and the features, being particularly keen to try out the anti-crease feature.

Pluses are the large capacity, the quiet operation, the spin speed and the clear display. Accessing some of the features through the touch screen is a bit fiddly, and the drawer for the soap / fabric softener could feel more robust and have a smoother action. The steam has helped with my time spent on ironing, but it's not perfect - though that could just be me getting used to it.

All in all, happy with this machine, and I would recommend to others",Approved
"New kitchen but wanted a built in appliance. Concerned about the size and performance of built in appliances. This is perfect, large size, works well and lots of nice features, no regrets in buying.",Approved
The only disappointment is that it has a slightly smaller interior than my previous fridge and I assume this is because it is frost free. However I love the layout of the interior particularly the 3drawers and be able to always be aware due to an excellent digital digital display I am sure I am going to be very satisfied with this product,Approved
Great cooker once you get the hang of it takes a little time to get use to having no buttons and don't expect the manual to help because it does not make sense but now we are up and running cookers great and the speed it heats up is amazing it has many different features some we are still learning about like the way it lets you know when cooker is at temp and how long it's been on as well as a timer.Would recommend this cooker it looks great and has a large oven and oven/grill one of the biggest I've seen in along time. Super is well worth the money. Just one word of warning check your saucepans may need new ones we did.,Approved
"Delighted with the washing machine, easy to operate with good results.",Approved
"Having spent a lot of time researching and looking at premium machines (LG, Samsung, Miele) this offered the best features at the right price. I am very pleased to be able to wash clothes in 20-30 mins, with great results. I like the steam function - it really does cut down on ironing but you should hang/fold straight out the machine. My whites are a lot whiter now with this new machine.
Downside- only 1600 spin on cotton wash. I get around this by finishing off the wash as ‘spin only’ and selecting 1600 but you can’t do this with steam washes as it would crease again!
Steam function only available on a couple of washes as part of the cycle, but can be selected on its own afterwards.
Touch buttons are very sensitive and can be pressed too many times by mistake taking ages to cycle round chosen spin or temp.
Overall all I highly recommend this machine. It is virtually silent and don’t know it’s on sometimes!
I now enjoy laundry!!",Approved
Very good machine. Excellent spin. Very happy with the Variety of programs.,Approved
"Really researched this product before buying. It had all the features and more that I wanted. When it arrived and ready for use it is the most straightforward machine I have ever had but with all the technology. Smooth to use dials and touch buttons. Visual display clear and concise. Steam program great for shirts. I did think that the steam program would be added onto your selected wash however, didn't think it was separate. It does make sense though because you can use it independently.",Approved
"Ive had my cooker for a few weeks, and although some reviews said it was tricky to get the hang of, I have had no problem. I really like the digital display (no more greasy controls) and the induction hob is just supreme. The speed of heating is amazing I LOVE IT !!",Approved
"As stated above this cooker is good for the price, but sorry to say not as good as the New World cooker, which it replace. The one it replaced was over 25years old, and as still Woking, but I decided to get a new one before it became faulty.Although this cooker fits into the space, the inside is not as big as my old one, but as I now only have to cook for myself, it is OK. It looks good and it was the only one I found in my price range that has a glass lid, which I think, makes it neater All in all I am very pleased with the cooker, and look forward to many more years of service.",Approved
"Well designed and smart. The suction and beating is very effective; the tools are efficient, it's easy to empty and has a very long lead. It's also pretty quiet and not too heavy to carry up stairs. Highly recommended.",Approved
"Nothing is ever perfect, but this washer drier gets close. The drier works well as long as you don’t overload it, and it’s quiet enough to put on overnight. 

Cons:
- We know the weight limits for washing and drying, but without weighing my clothes before putting them in the machine there’s no way to know how much we’re putting in, and how much to take out for the drying stage. 
- After a wash there is a small amount of water that pools in the door seal and doesn’t drain away. This is sorted by soaking it up with a cloth, but annoying to have to remember to do every time.",Approved
"This is the third AEG washer dryer we have bought . Over the years the design and quality have been maintained at the highest standard. The only reason we had to buy this one is because we donated our old one to a family member. The only challenge I have is understanding all the new washing and drying programmes, but as I'm getting on a bit it's to be expected! Highly recommend.",Approved
"The price they charged us for our cooker, has dents in it , and the oven is so small it is not the size they advertised you would not be able to get a normal dish in it Plus we never had a grill pan handle, you can see it is a used cooker as under the rings you can see they have spray painted it,
We have not used it yet as we are waiting for the gas company to instal gas to our property. In October Very disgruntled customer",Approved
"I have been pleased with the machine so far. There are a couple of minor niggles which prevent me from giving it 5* overall. One is the lack of a very quick wash, as the 20 mins one on my old machine was very useful. I also find the touch buttons a bit fiddly, and would prefer proper buttons, but that is probably just me. I also cannot open the door with a washing basket underneath, and I find that just slightly annoying. Overall though I'm very happy with it. The wash and dry both work well, and it has a good spin.",Approved
"This is my third AEG washing appliance and love the advances made in technology. I found it very easy to work out the controls and it is great to be able to alter spin speed, temperature and length of wash cycle. The machine seems well built and hopefully will live up to the AEG reputation for quality and reliability. Laundry is clean and well spun and the softrinse seems to be dispensed when it should be, ie. with the final rinsing cyle. My only gripe is that it is not the quietest of machines, especially on drying as the pump makes considerable noise. Luckily it is in the kitchen and we do not have open-plan living so not too obtrusive.",Approved
Product is well made with a good design. There are an impressive range of features and settings and it produces excellent washing and drying results. Very pleased with the product,Approved
"WE had an AEG washer drier already which was eleven years old and used at least three times a week if not more. We were having a couple of problems with it so decided to replace it with an up to date machine. This washer drier is far better than the old one, we find all the features to be an improvement. Far cheaper to run as well. So far we cannot fault this machine.",Approved
"Overall the build quality is brilliant - it is really quiet and every setting I've used gives a great wash. It also looks great. The steam function is really good, especially for sheets that have wrinkled in the drier! The non-stop 60 minute wash and dry is also great and really works.
Only thing I would like to have added is a few more quick wash options - most of the quick washes are around 1 hour, with only 1 under 40 minutes. Would be nice to have a 30 minute quick wash available.",Approved
"Bought to replace similar AEG model which had a failed bearing after 6 years.

Very happy with it but I wish it didnt have any ""touch"" buttons, it has some, and just like all appliances with them, they dont always work as reliably as a press button.

Programmes fine EXCEPT, why no quick wash? Yes you can speed up a normal wash, but we used to have a 20 minute wash on our old machine, the quickest now is a delicates with shortening which comes down to 40 mins. 

It would be even better if we could programme our own combinations, i.e. we always would want 1600 rpm but this is only possible on the cottons",Approved

Lots of gurgling and hissing noises which I feel is a downside,Approved
Only had a few weeks but so far impressed with most of the design features. Drawers not as deep as our other freezer but the extra height makes up for the volume we require. Like the see through drawers although have a little concern the drawers may become brittle with age and maybe crack or snap with wear?,Approved
It was easily installed and settled down quickly. Reservations as to whether the drawer runners would still be as successful when cold unfounded. This was a major feature that helped us decide as was the robustness of the fittings.,Approved
"I took a while to look into the functionality of freezers, as in the last 25 years, I've never had to buy one from new. The setup was easy, functionality exactly what you would expect, the space in the trays perfect not too big that you can't find things and not to small that you couldn't fit all your freezer food. Only down side, I'm 5ft 4 looking into the first tray from the top, is not possible, but I have a step for kitchen cupboards. so no real issue.",Approved
Bought on the strength of the Which recommendation the washer/dryer lives up to its billing. Replacing a 16 year old Bosch what has impressed is its ease of use and quietness. Good value for money.,Approved
bought for my elderly mother & is perfect for her to use. stylish & great quality.,Approved
"This is a good washer dryer, and I have found that it washes, and cleans efficiently, much better than my old machine (also an AEG). It is smaller than comparable machines. The ability to wash then automatically dry is useful.

However it is let down by a tricky user interface. The buttons have no tactile feel, and there is often a delay before the machine responds, so you end up pressing them quite hard to get a response, when you ought to be able to touch them gently and feel a click. Some of the fairly commonly used features, are accessed via combinations of several buttons, making them even harder to use. Many features are not intuitive so you have to keep the user manual to hand in order to get the most out of the machine.

My other criticism is that some programmes are rather slow. This can be a problem if you want to get more than one wash done in a day.",Approved
"We are so pleased with this machine. Washer dryers often struggle to match what a separate washer and dryer can do, but with this one we are genuinely achieving clean and perfectly dry laundry, with the convenience of setting it once to do both jobs, and the space saving benefits of only needing one machine. It is simple to programme and customise the cycles, with the screen readouts making it perfectly clear what the cycle will be and what stage it is at. Extremely quiet as well as energy efficient - we are delighted with the performance. Top notch.",Approved
This product is truly amazing. It replaces another aeg washer/drier which also gave us great service for over 8 years. It took us a couple of hours to work everything out to do exactly what we wanted from our washing. As always aeg have come up with an amazing machine. Thank you.,Approved
"Up and running in no time. So easy to use, programs well laid out on the front of the machine.
Washes really well, and no problem using the drying function (contrary to some reports)

Washes extremely well but length of time longer than we are used to. Drying takes a very long time and clothes more creased than we had hoped for.

"My only criticism is the placement of the operation switches at the bottom of the freezer - being one of more advanced years I find it very difficult to get down on my hands and knees to adjust the temperature etc. also it's not very easy to read the details on the knobs in this undignified position. However, now that it is up and running I am delighted with the freezer and especially delighted that I will not have to worry about defrosting it every now and again.",Approved

Range of washer/dryer settings; easy to make the appropriate choice of programmes and with good drying facilities.,Approved

"This is the first washer/dryer that I have bought and I was unsure whether it would work as well as the separate washer and dryer that I had previously. However so far it was worked very well, washing and drying clothes without any problems, especially the drying has outperformed my expectations. I bought this machine because it had the largest capacity for a slim depth machine which I needed because pipes at the back of the cupboards mean a full depth machine will stick out too far. At 8kg wash/5kg dry cottons and 3kg wash and dry synthetics it is more than adequate for my requirements. It is very quiet too. The only feature I would like to have seen on this machine that is available on other AEG models is the night-time/quiet mode which takes the spin cycles out of the program so you can run the machine at night without disturbing the neighbours. Apart from that I am very pleased with the washer/dryer.",Approved
The slid out shelf and self cleaning option s are great. Looking forward to using the plug in joint thermometer as well!,Approved
"we already had a leg dryer and have been very impressed with it performance and the programs.so when our washer of ten years started making funny noises and noticeing small holes appearing in some items of clothing, time for a new machine.
after looking at the aeg with its woolmark accreditation hopefully it would care for our clothes and the steam function it was a safe bet .the ability to tailor some programs is easy to master and the 20 min quick wash is a great function,also the okomix which mixes detergent and or softer with water before touching the clothes we think has made a notable difference to the smell of the clothes and the overall clean and no detergent patches that sometimes appeared on clothes with our old machine.so overall really pleased",Approved
Very useful in a small area. Quite light so easy to manoeuvre.,Approved
"Love this machine it holds more washing than my old one and is so easy to used, the washing comes out stunning.",Approved
"So easy to use. Glides very well round furniture, saves so much time not having to plug in each room. Picks up very well, used daily. I can't fault it.",Approved
I like that my Zanusi refrigerator is spacious and has these nice gadgets to get a great usage of the space inside.,Approved
"We bought this dryer to deal with a large family household. The size was good but ultimately the sensor in the machine only works if the clothes are really damp. If something is slightly damp or parts of the clothing are damp like the waste on a pair of jeans then the machine won't sense it so won't dry at all.
So the big problem with this machine is that there is no manual over ride.
Which I think goes to show that the designers on this product haven't done enough research. So after 3 months of use I would say we are very disappointed.",Approved
"A really great fridge freezer, plenty of room in the two large salad drawers, also the large drawer in the freezer is very useful. Very bright led light inside the fridge, good not hailing a sticking out handle.",Approved
I'm new to the whole idea of using steam and why i would but i read up when i was looking to replace my old machine and it seem like a good idea and it was well worth it.,Approved
Impressed that the machine weighs the load and then adjusts the time of the wash.,Approved
"I bought it because of the reputable brand, nice design. However a full battery charge is barely enough to do one room. Also, the brush cleaning feature doesn't clean the centre of the roller, so it has to be taken out anyway. Give the poor battery performance, there is no facility for swapping batteries.
Disappointing.
PS: absurd T&C for this review.",Approved
"The battery only worked for minutes even though it was fully charged and lights indicated it was fully charged. Bought it to vacuum the stairs and car. Second time I used it, battery drained within 30 seconds. Had been charging overnight. Took it back, very disappointed.",Approved
"The machine has sufficient power to do all the cleaning that I need without recharging, including a quick go around the car. It's light and easy to carry around the house, which is what I sought when I bought this model. It''s not only efficient, but good to look at too.",Approved
"Spent a couple of days online checking reviews on tumble dryers and also which? online.This Zanussi was highly recommended at the price range I was looking to pay and it had to be good to equal my old Bosch.
A great buy......dries clothes perfectly and the sensor is an added bonus.This is no tortoise and dries fast and without fuss.Easy to clean the filters and the condenser is nicely placed at the top and simple to empty.
I highly recommend this Zanussi tumble dryer!!",Approved
"The plastic drawers feel quite brittle.
There seems to be a tendency for the drawers to become very condensated very quickly. Old design wire baskets better in some respects
Controls very handy at top.",Approved
This was bought to replace my previous Zanussi tumble dryer. I bought the same again as I was very happy with it but this new one has a drying sensor which stops drying when it thinks your clothes are dry. Unfortunately this is not always the case. It is so frustrating as your clothes come out still wet! Apart from this it is a good dryer. I like the water tank being at the top of the machine instead of at the bottom like on my last one. Controls are easy to use. Would definitely buy Zanussi again although would think twice about one with sensor drying.,Approved
Like the simple way to add steam to cooking. It makes it easy to cook food that's crispy without it being wet as I thought it would be,Approved
Clothes are noticeably cleaner than with our previous washing machine.,Approved
"I was a little bit overwhelmed when I first got this machine, but not to be outdone I read the manual (or most of it). The most impressive looking feature is the display panel, it looks very high tech, but when you look carefully at all the buttons it is self explanatory. The spin speed, number of rinses and just about anything else can be adjusted at the touch of a button. I like that there is a separate compartment for stain removers and that this and washing powders are mixed prior to being added to drum, makes sense. I like the easy adjustment of spin speed and that the wash can be cut short for lighter soiled washing with the 'time save' feature. I haven't had to use the anti allergy feature as this isn't relevant to me. The 3kg load for 20 minutes is great if like my family they suddenly decide something must be done now and not when there is a full load. The duvet setting will be great when I want to freshen them up, no more trips to the laundrette! It's good that there a 'Woolmark' recommended setting, I hate washing woollens by hand, I was impressed that my jumpers were well looked after when I got them ready for winter. The delayed start is a good idea, but not really relevant to me as I am at home most of the time. The only thing I have not mastered is the freshen up / steam feature, I didn't find that creases came out and the clothes weren't slightly damp, they were quite wet. Overall, I am very impressed with this machine, it has an incredibly large capacity of 10kg, is very quiet in use and washes clothes just as it should. The quality has led me to consider other AEG items when I replace my fridge freezer and othe kitchen goods shortly.",Approved
"I Love It. This is the best, I like it so much I got more than 1.",Approved
"I was a bit intimidated by all the features on the control panel at first, but the manual explains it all well and I quickly got the hang of all the choices. You can do pretty much anything you'd think a wash machine capable of, and more! It has competently handled everything I've thrown at it, including a king sized duvet, down pillows, and sleeping bags. I'm really happy it has an allergy setting too, as my husband suffers from dust mite allergy. But the thing I was most pleased with is the 'Refresh' setting, which gently tumbles your clothes while steaming them; this is fantastic for jackets and blazers (non-wool ones)! I'm also pleased there's a similar setting to remove creases the next time we forget our business shirts in the dryer. This machine alters the time to wash etc depending on your load, and is much more quiet than our last one. I can't fault it.",Approved

"I've had this washer dryer for a week now, catching up on the back log of washing. My previous machine was a direct drive and was quiet, the AEG is even quieter on the wash cycle (had to check it was still on), on the first wash the final spin was exceptionally quiet, since then the final spin has got a little louder (guess the machine has bedded in) which is why I've given it 4*'s.
The wash cycles whilst long (which is probably why it has such fantastic washing results, old stains came out), aren't too much longer than most decent machines. You can shorten some of the programmes significantly. You can also add some additional rinses (on cottons you can add up to 5 additional rinses). The choose of programmes is good (I had a machine that had a lot of programmes and used 4 of them). The dryer is no longer than my previous washer dryer (and dries more than my old one) so I'm pleased with that, if I dry the same amount as my old machine it's an hour quicker! 
The stain option I have found to be useful, especially with having dogs that like to jump up on you with filthy paws.
The is also a fluff removal programme which is handy after drying my towels as it stops fluff from getting on to my clothes (it's also handy after I've washed the dogs bedding).",Approved
"Please take your time to read this.
It may be long but I could have left a review after a couple of days of ownership with no underpinning or substantiation to the review.
I have had this cooker for over a month now and used it daily.
Get a beer or wine out & read on please.
I do nearly all of our cooking & have had two very, very good dual fuel cookers over the past 10 years or so.
Double oven (fan in main oven), gas hob and they were both very good to use.
I read up on induction hobs (power, speed, efficiency etc.) and decided to get one.
Looked long & hard for a few weeks & settled for this superb cooker.
Top tip: If you really want to know what a product is like and what al of it's features are, then read as many reviews as you can but just as important, download the user manual from the manufacturer's website.
You'll get more from that than you will do from a 'technical spec' page from where you are looking to purchase it from.
Right then, review time.
It looks very elegant & stylish.
Touch controls do take a little bit of learning but with so, so many features what do you expect!
Compared to my 2 previous cookers this thing is a technological powerhouse :)
The hob is amazing. 
Using my tired & tested Circulon Ultimum pans (not cheap but worth every penny BTW) I have found the hob to be faster my previous gas hobs, just as controllable and with 4 benefits.
1. As it is very efficient & just heats up the base of the pan, the pan handles do not get as hot as when using a well controlled gas hob.
2. The lower power settings and keep warm function are brilliant, much lower that a low gas flame.
3. You can program each heating zone to turn off after a set time.
4. The stop-go function is very nice to have. (turns all hob zones to 'keep warm' when you activate it and back to where they were when you de-activate it.
Top oven & grill are great. Grill pan is the full width of the cooker & uses the rails that the oven racks use (and is enormous).
Plus the top oven is multi-function with multiple variations for where the heat will come from, including being used along with the grill and a keep warm function and fully programmable with delayed start.
Oh yeah, and a light in it. Which is unusual but great to have.
Triple glazed door on both ovens keep the heat in so much better than my previous ovens did.
The main oven is huge. My previous cooker had a large main cavity but this is even bigger.
Advances in thermal insulation technology I suppose.
It has even more functions than the top oven and is simply brilliant to use.
Both the top & main oven will go in 5deg C increments from 30 all the way to 280!!
Gently dry some tomatoes without the sun or let someone who can't cook REALLY cremate some food ;-)

If you're still reading breath a sigh of relief, I've finished.
10/10 Amazing product.",Approved
"We chose this machine as we have had an AEG based machine before.
The pump/drain filter, for some bizare reason is sited so close to the ground, you can`t avoid pouring water onto the floor when this filter needs cleaning. Also the "" Aquastop"" water inlet hose is rather short and somewhat awkward to fit ...our machine is around 50cm from the water supply ...not close enough for the pipe supplied. AEG provide a longer one...cost £25:50 plus P/ P ...bit of a cheek on an £820 machine.
Slightly odd smell...but may be down to it being new...although there was water already in system on opening...maybe this is normal priming but nothing in the instructions. Also not as quiet on the drying cycle as I`d expected. Very very fast spin though...which is quiet.
Good points is a 5 year warranty...but you have to register to get this.
Time will tell.",Rejected
Loved the stick vac until it broke just outside its warranty. Fortunately have extended warranty with Amazon,Approved
Invested in AEG paying the hefty premium over other reputable makes such as BOSCH hoping it will pay off in the long run. Bad investment since the water pump had to be replaced within 3months and subsequently in the 3rd year the drum mount failed. Features were similar to other brands and the aesthetic design was simple and effective. Wouldn't recommend AEG since we also had similar issues with the dryer. The products have been extremely well maintained and the failures were associated with simply poor quality parts that could not have been avoided no matter what we did.,Approved
"I still can't believe how brilliant this washing machine is! My last washing machine was also an AEG and I have had such great service from it that updating to another AEG was always going to be my choice. When it arrived I couldn't stop looking at it - it's beautiful, and after reading through the instructions and getting started I'm absolutely delighted with the results - whites have taken on a new lease of life, clothes seem newer and stains are non existent even marks on tea towels that have remained feint after being washed before 2 or 3 times are now gone! It's so quite and there are so many brilliant facilities on this machine, The drum is large enough to wash a king size duvet perfectly, the 20 min - 3kg wash is just perfect for towels and swim suits after the family have been to the swimming pool, this clever machine weighs the clothes as you put them in the drum so you never over load, you can change the spin speed if you wish and use the time save if your in a hurry. Running costs excellent I'm still in green low consumption on my smart metre (what a difference). I simply love it!",Approved
"Disclosure: I was selected by the manufacturer to receive this product free of charge in return for an honest impartial review. This is a great washing machine with a large drum and some great features. It weighs the washing as you put it in so no risk of overloading and ensures the clothes are cleaned most effectively. There are lots of programmes which can be a little daunting but after trying out a few it was easy to work out the favourites and which work for which purpose. I really like the way you can customise your wash to suit by reducing the time, temperature and spin on some programmes as well as adding in a prewash for really grubby clothes. I have been really impressed with the great job the washing machine does on a load of clothes and had no issues with the quality of the clean at all. It is especially brilliant when you consider that it delivers such high performance on such efficiency. There are also two steam settings which are perfect for dry clean only clothes or for freshening up suit jackets. I would recommend this washing machine to anyone looking for an all-rounder that suits lots of purposes. Great work AEG!",Approved
"We were fortunate enough to receive this washing machine free of charge from AEG in return for an impartial review.

We are extremely pleased with this washing machine. Our initial impression was that this machine is aesthetically pleasing. It has a large number of programme options, however, navigating and selecting programmes is very straightforward.

It has a large capacity drum, which we have found particularly useful when washing bedding and towels. Being environmentally minded, we particularly like the fact that the machine is extremely energy efficient, additionally it optimises the amount of water used and informs you how much washing liquid to use based on the weight of the washing loaded, thus reducing waste. 

The machine clearly shows the stage of the programme it is currently on, and has a useful countdown timer so it is evident when the programme will finish, moreover it is extremely quiet even when at full spin. The spin performance of the machine is very good because the washing seems drier than with my previous machine.

I have tried to select 5 stars for this product but it keeps reverting to 4 stars!",Approved
"great washing machine , we had one before and that lasted for 7 years. But the new one we have now is quieter and washers cleaner and the clothes are dryer when they come out , simple to use, would recommend to anyone, great product.",Approved
"I was selected by AEG to receive the product free of charge in return for my honest review.

This is the quietest washing machine I have ever used! Even when it was spinning it wasn’t at all noisy. The washing machine does have a fair few features so I was slightly overwhelmed at first, but it is actually really simple to use.

The steam function has to be one of my all-time favourite features; from working in an office and being sat down all day, I find that my jackets and trousers can get elbow and knee marks. The steam function, which even works on dry clean only clothes, freshens everything up and puts them back into shape. The clothes come out very slightly damp, but they are fresher and it will save me so much time and effort by not having to take them to the dry cleaners so often.

Overall the machine is well made and sturdy. It also looks good and fits well into a modern kitchen/utility area. Highly recommended!",Approved
"We opted for the aeg washing machine as we were fed up with buying cheaper machine that kept breaking down,we were not disappointed, although the warranty isn’t as long as some it certainly does it’s job, with 3 kids our machine is on more often than not , this machine is a prime example of German engineering!",Approved

"Bought this to upgrade our 8yr old AEG machine, which was still performing well but finding we needed a bigger wash load capacity. This is perfect! Large opening, 8kg capacity, full range of wash programs and loving the steam feature - great for managing the dog bedding especially. It’s also a really quiet machine, gives a thorough wash and very effective spin so laundry comes out spotlessly clean and takes less drying time. I can’t fault it at all; very pleased and know from experience I can trust the longevity of AEG appliances.",Approved
"Love it! Fantastic washing machine, quick and easy to use, nothing to complain",Approved
"Fantastic washing machine, can alter 99% of all programs, with shorter times, different spin speed and different temperature, so you can really tailor the wash to your own requirements. With the larger wash load you can get all your bedding in, in one lot and and it's not overloaded as the machine will let you know if there is too much. It is very quiet, and gives a fantastic wash. It is a brilliant replacement to my last AEG washing machine, which lasted 13 years, so here is hoping the quality of the new machine remains the same with all the extra features, as it will make it an awesome bit of kit that I own.",Approved
This under the counter fridge is very very quiet and works well,Approved
"Further to installation, the washer’s first cycle alerted me to a fault with the mains water supply, (thank you AEG) so after eventually completing 2 maintenance cycle’s to clear manufacturing deposits, I was already impressed with the quite operation of the machine, I decided to trial the 19minute quick wash....how useful is that going to prove on occasions, especially when my son is home during summer. Results amazing. Followed with white bedding and towels through the hottest, longest, cycle, using less detergent than recommended (I do use a chemical free brand); the laundry was clearly whiter and brighter. A few more cycles using this superb machine to capacity, I was raving....it is brilliant from every aspect,; easy to use, despite the basic instruction manual; quiet, even during fast spin; feels sturdily made, especially compared to competition (better known for their mobile phones), duvet washed perfectly (no more laundry service costs), I have even dared to wash a light coloured silk coat with fantastic results. The steam refresh is brilliant and will be used frequently to eliminate ironing. I love this machine and look forward to as many years of trouble free use as the one my mum purchased in 1968, finally upgrading in 1991. Highly recommended.",Approved
"Its hard to get excited about a washing machine but this model really is amazing. It looks stylish and modern and has plenty of features for every family need. It is very quiet and economical and produces fantastic results on every cycle. The steam feature really does reduce the creases to save on ironing time. The garment care feature makes sure the detergent and softener reaches every fibre leaving your clothes cleaner and softer. It has Pro sense technology which automatically weighs each load and adjusts the wash time to protect your clothes and save on water and electricity. It has a large drum and door, great spin, delayed start, child lock, etc It ticks all the boxes.",Approved
"Looks very good in my kitchen, I like that it has fast warm up feature and loads of different power settings options. The probe works well, so in general very pleased with the purchase.",Approved

"I have yet to try all the features of my new oven. I think I can say that once I have mastered all the controls and varieties of cooking options, I will love it.",Approved
"Really please with the look and performance of this oven. Control knobs push away for a 'sleek' frontage. Very easy to keep clean, just a quick wipe after each use and all shelves and panels can be removed and put in the dishwasher if needed, although I haven't had to do this as yet. Great product all round.",Approved
"Have been using the machine for a few weeks now and so far very impressed. Firstly the build quality stood out, this is a very solid appliance, evident when the delivery man commented that it’s the heaviest washer he’s delivered. When opening and closing the door there is no bending and flexing of the cabinet as you do so, unlike much cheaper machines. The controls are very easy to use, with plenty of information displayed. The only thing that can be a little confusing are the sheer number of features and options, but this isn’t a bad thing as it means the wash can be customised to suit what you’re putting in. Our house has dogs and a cat so the ability to add up to 3 rinses is great for removing pet hair. The soft plus option works really well for bed linen, it comes out soft and fresh, and needs virtually no ironing. The OKOpower program is great for every day use, it takes just over a half load and will be done in an hour, although adding some of the options means it will take a bit longer, but still very fast. The ÖKO mix feature seems to do a good job of distributing the detergent and softener through the laundry, as it smells cleaner and fresher than it did from my old machine. 
The steam function is good for refreshing clothes that have been stored away for a while. 
The pro sense feature warns you if you have overloaded the drum, I think this has a lot to do with why the results are better, as I’ve been removing items to make sure it doesn’t have too much in it.
This also has to be the quietest washer I’ve used, even on a full 1600 spin it doesn’t disturb and you can still have a conversation, when not spinning you barely hear it. Ours is in a utility room, but I’d happily use it in an open plan environment, it’s so quiet. Overall delighted with this fantastic washer and it looks really good also, not something you can say about a lot of white goods.",Approved
"Very happy with my purchase. The air condition unit it’s very silent and does a geat job. The materials used are high quality. All in all great product 
Thanks",Approved
"This us a great product that has fantastic features. And it looks good Clothes feel fresh and clean and really washed. I love the steam function and the anti allergy functions as I have sensitive skin.
Although it is on the pricey side and could be a bit cheaper My main issue is the instruction Manuel. This could be much clearer to enable you to use the machine to uts best advantage . I currently feel I'm not doing this and could be getting more out of it 
I would recommend this product to anyone.",Approved
"It takes a while to learn all the new controls and programs and still surprised how long some of the programs are even with timesave activated ( over 2hrs) .Washing quality is good . It seems to work better with liquid detergent than powder detergent . The power detergent seems to get crusty and stay in the drawer and not all get washed into the drum so we switched to liquid . We like the timesave control. In addition,it takes some time to realise which programs leave water in the drum which you forget about after returning after a days work .... We also like the short 20 minute program which works well for low soil sports clothes.",Approved
"Lots of good features but requires a degree to work out the settings effectively ...it has a mind of its own, literally!",Approved
"Wow, totally blown away by the difference between this washer dryer and my last 3 yr old washer dryer.

Our new AEG is a beautiful machine, it does exactly what it is supposed to do: wash and fully dry clothes! I didn’t think it was possible to have completely dry clothes from a combo machine. But it is! 
Pros:There are a large number of settings to choose from, the very large drum allows for huge loads ( necessary for a family of 4) and I also love the steam feature which releases wrinkles from linens and such.

Did I mention that it fits in a normal width space and only requires a deeper slot.

Very very pleased customer!",Approved
"I'm still trying out the main features of this machine - for example I can now do a really quick wash and also get my towels nice and soft. I have not used a liquid washing product yet, only powder and am very happy with the quality of the wash.

"Everything works well, no problems at all. Good functionality and the oven is a good size with good accessibility.",Approved
"After our last AEG washer dryer finally broke after 10 years of great service, we decided to stay with AEG and buy their latest model.
This machine is quiet, efficient and washes and dries exactly as we would expect from AEG. Although we have only had it for a few weeks, its so far been absolutely as expected. It washes very well but we had to set the machine to double rinse as a single rinse still leaves some soapy residue. this can be set easily and becomes the default feature and only adds a few more minutes to a wash. I think the auto dry can be a little over the top. When we set it to auto dry it sometimes says 3:30 hours but if we set it manually to 2 hours, the clothes come out absolutely dry but I am not sure if the machine will adjust as it goes along.

Overall, im very pleased with this machine.",Approved

"I have owned AEG washing machines now for over 16 years. 18 Months ago I purchased this machine from John Lewis, so its had a reasonable amount of time to settle in.

Far from being quite, this machine made far more noise than the old AEG that it replaced. After a few months we called John Lewis who sent out an engineer who identified that the shock absorbers had not been tightened on the machine properly when it was built. I asked him if this was an installation issue and he was catagoric that it was not. This made the machine run a lot quiter, but it is far from the expected machine that I bought, only now marginally quiter than the old one. The engineer checked it out and confirmed that it should be quiter, but that there was nothing he could do due to the fact that the components that would be creating the sound were sealed and short of a full replacement there was nothing that could be done.

I am not left with a very good feeling about now having to live with this machine for a good number of years yet (assuming ti does not fall to bits), and would go for another premium German brand the next time around.",Rejected
"I got this washing machine for some time now after a frustrating tme with two other brands. I was just browsing to look for the machine's cleaning pack .. you know the stuff you put in every so often to sterilize the machine and just seen the option of putting a review here so I thought of letting every one know my how good it is. This machine is marvellous, in my case I run it between 1-3 loads a day with all the kids mess. The power consumption is far better than rivals. The best thing is that it tailors the cycle intelligently to what and how heavy your laundry is. It is as quiet as mouse and it just has that attractive elegant looks. I have had no issues. Overall, This is one washing machine that AEG should keep as their flagship",Rejected
"The washing function on this machine is fine, and the dryer worked fine for the first year that we have had it. However it has now starter leaking water from the bottom left hand side during the drying function, auto or timed dry. If the machine is left to dry for longer than an hour the floor will be filled with water. A technician came out and did not even attempt to fix the machine, stating that this was a known fault with the machine and that, as of yet, there was no resolution to the problem and that the manufacturer was working on resolving the issue. Then a week later the technician came back with his manager and they changed some parts and cleaned the machine of fluff, however this has actually made the problem worse, with water now leaking on the drying function after 30 minutes!

A technician is now coming back next week, but it seems like they don't really know how to fix this problem and I am unable to leave this machine drying without checking it every 30 minutes to mop up water. Very disappointed with this expensive machine and will be requesting a replacement/refund if the problem is not fixed.",Rejected

"Functional but very Noisy, even noisier than my old 10 years old fridge.",Approved
"I was very nervous about putting down such a large amount of money for a washer dryer - but it was our only practical solution. We do not have space for a separate dryer, and drying clothes indoors was creating mould problems. There was also the issue of loss of space with two clothes airers on the go constantly for our family household. We also did not want to increase our electricity bills dramatically with a traditional dryer - heat pump was the only solution we would entertain. The considerable electricity savings help to justify the investment.

It works amazingly well, with only one flaw - make sure you wash ladies underwear and bras separately on the delegates wash and do not dry them in the machine. We have destroyed a few items before we learnt this.

Other than that, works perfect: can wash, dry or wash & dry. We use the sensor for dryness and based on cupboard dry everything is always exactly cupboard dry. A washer dryer that actually works! Wash performance is good and noise level is good. Unit is a little tall, but the feet can be adjusted downwards from their standard setting when shipped.

It is very heavy and not recommended for one person to install, although I did.

5 year warranty parts and labour - I have no doubt it will continue to perform.

A little sad, but this is actually one of the best things we've bought... it's a great timesaver too. Don't be worried about spending the money on this.",Approved
"I cannot fault this washing machine in any way. The look, the performance, the 9kg capacity and the lovely soft texture of the laundry (it even takes into account the hardness of our water) is second to none. To start with I was a little apprehensive about using the App but this has proved to be unfounded on my part. The ease of navigation around the site is fantastic. The washer is a definite upgrade to my previous machine in relation to the numerous different setting options, as well has to how quiet it actually is when running through the cycles.  I am extremely happy with this machine and would recommend it to anyone. A real investment and enhancement to any household.",Approved

"This oven has more bells / whistles than my previous one.

Like the pre-heating functionality",Approved
"Potentially a great machine with many flexible options, including a steam programme and water softening, let down by very poor quality control at the factory and poor quality customer service to deal with the fault. 

Bought a top of the range model, which like all AEG washing machines weighs the washing and adjusts the programme time accordingly or warns you if it is overloaded. Sadly my machine thinks it is overloaded even when it is empty! 

To date the fault has not been cleared and customer support non-existent except for a visit by a local electrical engineer on behalf of AEG, who could only confirm that the fault existed. 
Other manufacturers are already feature smart diagnosis of machine faults - a tool that I certainly would have benefitted from if AEG had adopted it into its design.

As it has been faulty from the start, I am concerned that its overall reliability will be equally poor. How soon will something else go wrong?",Approved
"Not the easiest of dishwashers to programme, especially as the easy user guide supplied with the machine was in Arabic, not what I expect when sold in the UK! I emailed Zanussi & a week later was sent the English instructions. I still can't set the machine to beep when the programme has ended so have given up on that altogether.",Approved

"We live in a hardwater area and partly selected this Washing Machine for its filtering system which softeners the water. We've noticed that our clothes are softer to the touch and fresher as a result. This is the quietest machine we've ever had. You hardly notice that its on!. Short OKO power programme for cottons and synthetics is only 59 minutes, and washing performance is excellent. Mainly use 'time save ' feature as cottons and synthetics with 'eco setting' are quite long. Really pleased with results though as clothes are holding their colour and seams, shirt collars and cuffs are not getting damaged in the cycle as sometimes happened with our previous machine. Real quality feel about this appliance, love the dial control and function symbols on LED control panel as easy to follow. Haven't quite worked out 'pro-sense' feature.

"Bought this product to replace a 3year old hotpoint that was well beyond saving, spent a lot of time researching and even getting in touch with AEG themselves to gauge the customer service response. I must say. All has exceeded my expectations. Previous washing machine was a 11kg washer. Was so so worried about have to go down to a 9kg drum, but it seems to wash what I need to do with ease. Even super king size bedding sheets not an issue and comes out smelling clean. The eco wash is an amazing little button. Managed to get a wash on after the school run and dryed before my kids were in bed. FABULOUS. The salt function is a small relief and I must admit makes such a difference to my towels. Makes them softer in my opinion. All in all I’m so glad I bought this it may be expensive but with a 5 year warranty and a customer service team that are there to answer any questions you have Even if they seem silly. I’m already a very happy customer.",Approved
"Mechanically, the oven is excellent and performs very well. However, the user interface is rather clunky - in terms of sophistication it is mid-way between the push-button era and the fully digital era and unfortunately is more difficult to use than we are now used to. It is much slower to use than the old twirl the knob and push the button. More investment and effort in providing a more up to date interface would make this a better device.",Approved
"Product are easy to use and perform well. There are plenty of settings on each product e.g. oven, hob, dishwasher and washing machine. All th appliances are quiet when in operation..",Approved
"Just under a month in and we’ve given this machine a pretty good work out so far. There are five of us, we’re outdoor and sporty people and we have pets. So far I have no complaints, clothes are really clean and it is super quiet. Our old AEG OKO Lavamat lasted 14.5 years so this one has a tough act to follow but it’s looking good so far!",Approved
"I bought two of these ovens for my new kitchen so far can't fault the cooking experience using these ovens. My Yorkshire puddings with the steam option in use almost touch the roof of the oven.

"Tidy looking oven, fits a treat but like the curate's egg, good in parts. In fact excellent in parts but there are bit that could do with an overhaul. The dial for oven functions is not easily readable. Personally I have to take a torch to read it. I also find that the directions are not easily understood - perhaps I am just getting old! Having said all that, I am impressed by the looks and efficiency and as an experienced cook am pleased to have it.",Approved
"I replaced my old dish washer with this product after a recommendation in the shop. I am disappointed with the quality of the wash unless I have it at a high temperature. Also the racks are poor for stacking, and there is no holders to stop glasses from falling over and banging together.",Rejected
"Love the design and functionality of this appliance. It’s very high quality. Especially love having both ovens that are fan and have grills!
Minor issues - the clock loses time. The display is very faint and hard to see at some angles. You can’t just turn one oven off if you’re using both. The temperature gauge seems to be a bit off. The temperature it displays isn’t always true especially when you’ve had the oven operating then turn it up. 
But it’s a lovely oven to use overall",Approved
"The digital controls took time getting use too. I would strongly recommend to play around with it before using it. I like the fact that when the oven reaches the set temperature its bleeps. There are many settings to choice from. Also timer shows how long you had the oven on for. For me, the grill to heat up is very quick. Over all a great double oven.",Approved
First impressions not great as it broke after first usage. Still did not work after three parts replaced and finally replaced with new machine. Our old dishwasher was around 30 years old when we had our kitchen refurbished. It had never let us down in all that time but would not take a door to match the new kitchen so it had to go. The new Zanussi works but is not as effective at cleaning as our old Hotpoint. I would not recommend or buy another Zanussi dishwasher.,Approved
"Heat control is impossible to regulate, stays very hot, have to wait for the hob to cool down or move the pan half way across the hob
Switch on low heat and wait for ages to get to the right temperature!
Difficult to clean, very small space ( a fingers width) between individual hobs just cannot get between them to clean.
Who ever designed this had obviously never boiled an egg! Very very disappointed.",Approved
"Early days yet, but seems to do exactly what we want. Had to install new electrical cables to suit the wattage, but it seems well worth it! Heats up very quickly and easy to control.",Approved

This oven looks great and seems quite easy to use. I haven't used all the features as yet but look forward to doing so soon.,Approved
"Changed from a 17yr old Miele, which we loved, but was falling apart. This has many good features and is very easy to use. I love the fact you use salt for hard-water areas, which ours is. I can’t say I notice any difference, but I really enjoy features like the steam one, the outdoor cycle, okomix etc etc. 

There aren’t too many dials and buttons to press and it also has a very nice styling about it, which I prefer over the old-school type knobs. It is a good-looking machine (and I spent weeks and weeks looking at machines, because the aesthetics are just as important to me as the functionality). The drum is deceptively large and seems to hold a lot. I also love the 1600 spin on some cycles, which means clothes dry quicker. 

Nothing to complain about, as it is much more advanced than the machine it replaced. Did we need to buy this particular model, probably not, but life is too short if you can stretch the budget.",Approved

"We had this hob installed in our new kitchen only 2 weeks ago but so far so good. It has clean lines and is stylish. However, one thing that I am slightly concerned about is that the 'H' displays (warning you that the rings may still be hot after cooking) disappear immediately when the hob is powered off. I would have thought that these should have been designed to stay on at least until the rings have cooled sufficiently.",Approved
Absolutely delighted with my new hob it easy to use and clean should have bought one years ago,Approved
I am pleased with my AEG oven. But disappointed that we had to have it repaired after only 4 days. One of the retractable knobs failed to work. However a repair was made and a new knob assy fitted,Rejected
Inner filter fell apart after only a few uses! Emailed and telephoned customer services several times and received no response!,Rejected
"I am thrilled with my new Zanussi dryer in every way. It is quiet to use, exceptionally efficient due to its humidity sensors and the different programmes all do what they say on the tin!

After my old dryer with just a low or high heat setting I can't believe how efficient and sensitive it is. It really is a superb machine .... Thank you!",Approved
I was a bit confused at first when I used my new Zanussi washing machine but it didn't take long for me to work out how to use it. My previous washing machine was a Zanussi and I had that one for 18 years and it gave me no problems. I am confident that this machine will be equally as good if not better,Approved
"Touch panel is very responsive. Heating panels are beautifully designed, heats up very fast for faster cooking and cools down quickly so safer for kids. Oven works perfectly, time and heat management functionality is quite helpful.",Approved
very easy to install and use also very quiet The choice of programs very good and the short 30min wash is excellent . My only quibble is the plastic stacking trays are a bit awkward to use but maybe this just me,Approved
"Have had this machine for about 4 weeks now and have put it through its paces! It’s performance is excellent, it’s very quiet but possibly a bit noisier on the spin than I expected however still lower than most machines I’ve had in the past. Love the fact that there are a good range of temperatures to choose from on the programs I use the most. I have used the steam option to lessen creases on my 100% cotton bedsheets and it does help although I have to take some of the laundry out and steam the load in two halves as the maximum load on this is 1.5k (which is necessary to get the full benefit of fewer creases.)
The design is good And the build quality appears to be very good too. A slight niggle for me is the handle for opening the door sticks out slightly and where my machine is located there is a small chance of something catching on it. The opening is a good size to allow easy access to filling and unloading the machine. 
Overall I would highly recommend it. I have an AEG induction cooker which I’ve had for 5/6 years now and it has been very reliable and well built. I would say the same about build quality and innovation of the washing machine and look forward to many years of use trouble free",Approved
"just love my new hob - clean lines, super fast option is great, easy to use and looks beautiful.",Approved
"Great clean , variety of washing times , good price",Approved
This oven combination has lots of variations some of which i have not tested yet. The oven installation was a bit unusual since it sits in a 600mm space and the oven brackets have to be screwed to the existing cabinets. I was a bit worried but once installed and located to the frame all is well. Quiet oven in use. Very flexible with 2 fan assisted ovens.,Approved

Very light and easy to use . Very good at getting rid of pet hair . Overall im very happy so far with it .,Approved
"Good for the price, needed to swap the door around which was fiddly, but otherwise pleased with it.",Approved
"Very disappointed. Used sparingly for 18 months before control board gave up and died. Would have bought and replaced this myself but at a cost of £178 it simply isn't worth the effort and I'll buy a machine from a 'less prodigious' company which, I'm sure, will last a tad longer.
E-mailed Zanussi for their thoughts - no reply...says it all",Rejected
"We bought this freezer as a replacement for a 1970s appliance, (long overdue).
The freezer is smaller on the outside, but is the same size as our old freezer on the inside. Just what was required for the size of room we keep it in. It's very quiet, freezes evenly, quickly and reliably.
The only complaint I have is the door really should have an open alarm fitted as someone accidently left the door slightly open and the front of the drawer containers were covered with ice. No alarm= accident waiting to happen!!!!!",Rejected
"Absolutely excellent. Lightweight, my wife can do the whole house without recharge and its so light that makes it a pleasure to use.",Approved
"My AEG is brilliant, easy to use, small container for dirt & dust but picks up so much it needs emptying each time I use it. As I suffer from wide-spread arthritis I really appreciate how easy vacuuming is now.",Approved
"The fridge freezer is fine, but the after sales by Zanussi leaves a lot to be desired. Bought this item from John Lewis, had a problem whilst under guarantee. Someone was sent to look and he said it needed replacing. Replacement requested by John Lewis, but Zanussi would not state whether it would be am or pm, then they said the driver would ring. Nothing heard by 4pm, so John Lewis contacted Zanussi who assured them that it was ""on the van for delivery this afternoon"". Nothing arrived and so John Lewis spoke to them again and this time they admitted that it was not on the van because they were out of stock! Waited a further week for replacement. NO apology from Zanussi, but John Lewis were brilliant. Have only ever bought Zanussi products in the past, but this is the last one. Very disappointed with their cavalier attitude.",Rejected
"Have had no problems with this freezer (although only a month old so . . .). Lots of space, and not noisy. seems to be running efficiently and keeping things cold! I like the variable temperature and freeze boost functions too.",Approved
"Have only used the plate warming function in this first month and that has been brilliant, look forward to using the bread dough proving function soon.",Approved
"This is by far the best investment I have made in my household for a while! The machine is excellent. It's sleek in design and easy to use.. The different programmes are efficient and useful. The noise levels are also really good - none of that thumping around that other machines can do. I love the steam function - really great addition.
I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has large washing loads and wants to maintain efficiencies in both time and energy whilst having cycles that can also cope brilliantly with smaller, more delicate cycles.",Approved
"This is a really good little hoover.
Lightweight and easy to use.
The roller part you get with this model for the handheld hoover is great for cleaning the settee and stairs.
Hoovering is no longer a chore!!!!!!",Approved
Lighter than my previous vacuum cleaners but equally as good suction very light which is what I need and easily manuoeverable in tight spaces and corners .,Approved
Initially the hob worked well but after a week the ignition spark developed a will of its own - working permanently. Only switching of the electric supply would stop it.,Approved
Love the way the machine measures the weight of the clothes to predict necessary washing time. Also it is great for removing dog hair from bedding.,Approved
"Very pleased with this hob.
Good basic gas hob.Well priced.
would buy zanussi again.",Approved
"My fridge had packed up & I found it difficult to find a replacement under-counter one with a reasonable sized freezer compartment. As I have a very small kitchen I was very pleased to discover this compact freezer. With a few adjustments to shelving under the stairs it fits perfectly & is out of the way. It is deceptive in the amount that can be stored in it & it will get well used over the festive period. Although in a cupboard, when the door is opened there is no noise from the motor. It keeps consistent temperature & I wish that I had discovered & purchased one sooner.",Approved
"Overall this machine looks great, is very very quiet, has lots of genuinely useful programs that actually work but the best thing about it is the way it cleans your clothes. They come out of the machine beautifully clean and soft, my last washer never seamed to remove all the soap and I didn't realise until i used this one. Because it has the water softener you only need to use a small amount of detergent and the rinse/spin performance is excellent , things like bed clothes come out lovely with not a trace of detergent , another great thing it the spin performance ,I transfer my washing onto a condenser dryer and because they come out of the washer with minimal water they dont take very long at all to dry, this saves me time, energy and minimises wear on my clothes with reduced drying time. Brilliant product! 

One point to watch, when the appliance is fitted ensure the adhesive sound barrier strips are fitted on the bottom of the cabinet, most fitters can't be bothered to do this which is a shame as they do make the appliance quieter and you'll be missing out on some of the performance you've payed for. This machine is so quiet when its working you forget its on, even on the top spin cycle, most washers sound awful, this one is not like that.",Approved
"After having 2 Bosch machines lasting me 10 years then 5 years i looked for a new washing machine which had a good guarantee with it, after reading lots of reviews i chose this machine, spending twice the money than i had before so i expected a lot from it.  It was delivered the end of november and i found it easy to use... after 1 month i had the anti-flood problem as another reviewer here had.  it was discovered on 23 dec so i didn't have use of the machine until 29 dec...meaning a huge amount of washing piling up over xmas.  it was repaired and lasted 4 days until the same fault... engineer came out again and found a leaking pipe inside the machine.... ow i need to decide wether to have a replacement machine or go back to my usual Bosch.",Approved
"I didn't realise how poor my old oven was until I installed this one.

The Zanussi heats up quickly to an accurate temperature and cooks evenly in all parts of the oven. I didn't realise how important that was until the Zanussi provided those qualities.

Nice looks and easy to operate.

I am really impressed",Approved
"The only problem we have had has been the oven light . after 2 months it went off so replaced it with one from Zanussi and after a month this too is failing It seems ok when the oven is cold but when it is hot it goes out and you cannot see how the cooking is going.

Apart from that very impressed with it",Approved
"The design of the dials which you push in to hide is a great idea. Clean looking lines and a good viewing window to check on cooking.
There are many programmes i have yet to try out, the ones i have used work really well. Easy to keep clean (self cleaning is one of the reasons i went for this model) Good size oven and a good price. Sturdy build and very good quality. Quiet fan oven.",Approved

Love AEG products over NEFF. I feel you get quality and not just a name with gimicks,Approved
THE PRODUCT HAS GREAT FEATURES IS CLASSY IN APPEARANCE WITH THE STAINLESS STEEL EASY CLEAN SURROUND. THE INTERIOR ALSO HAS EASY CLEAN AND SELF CLEANING PANELS.

"We have had the L9FEC966R for a couple of weeks now and so far are very impressed with it. Yes it is expensive and it doesn't have some of the gimmicks that other machines have in this price range, however, it is rock solid, extremely quiet even on the spin cycle, the drum is large and the built in water softener does make the washing come out softer. The cycle we use takes just under an hour for a full load although a small load takes much less. Excellent machine, have high hopes that it will out live our last one.",Approved
Still not had time to use all the features but experience so far has been excellent.,Approved
All the family have used the washing machine and we all agree that all our clothes are so much cleaner than the clothes we use to wash in our old previous washing machine. The best feature is the built in water softener especially for our area because of hard water and from research hard water does not dissolve the washing powder properly which caused skin irritations and sludge in the filter.,Approved
My last machine was very noisy. This one is the exact opposite and does what it says on the programme. Very satisfied.,Approved
"I sent an email asking if it was possible to use both top and bottom ovens at the same time. So far I have not received a reply. 

I really like the product but once this query has been answered, everything will be great.",Approved
This fridge is attractive and well made. Its very spactious with loads of shelves and storage bins,Approved
"I liked the look of this machine when I was looking around. Very happy that I bought it. It is very smart looking, looks great in my new utility room. Easy to use and efficient. Takes a good load of washing

I really need to read the instruction manual to use its features properly!,Approved
"Light, manuverable and great suction. The wife has some health issues, so was having difficulty with the normal upright vacuum. This is so handy and efficient.

Length of battery life would be an issue if trying to do whole house in one go. Perhaps a version with tools for furniture and for reaching to do skirting and corners would be even better suited to our needs. However this has been great value for money.",Approved

"I own the predecessor to this - the Zanussi ZRB32313WA

I initially bought this fridge, back in September 2013, because of the limited width my kitchen has available.
At 59.5cm wide, it really does ‘just’ fit into the space. (A 60cm wide fridge would be scratched if forced into the space.)

When I first started to search for a fridge-freezer, I was concerned that I would be limited to a few options, of basic machine with awful specifications and possibly cheap quality.
During my search, I found the Zanussi range offered this perfect width, but was also a high-spec’ machine (with a high energy rating of A+) but was also generous with internal space. It wasn’t cheap either at £419.99 I was buying something better than average.

I found that various sellers actually sell this same machine under variations of the same model number – the differences between each ‘version’ was as simple as the graphics stuck on the drawers, or how many plastic shelves are supplied for the fridge compartment.

The machine was bought locally from a Euronics store and was specially ordered in. It was delivered a few days later. It fitted perfectly into that 59.5cm space I had for it.
Perfect. When it use it made those ‘common’ fridge-freezer sounds, like bussing and the occasional crack. (At first these were alarming but there was a guide with the instructions that cleverly demonstrate the various noises the machine will make.)

I found the internal space fantastic for my needs:
For the fridge, a couple of bottles of wine in the rack, plenty of door shelving for my fruit juice, dairy items, and the two drawers fine for my vegetables. The rest of the trays held various other things like jams and chutneys.
For the freezer, the three drawers were great for storing meat and stock. For a single person, I could easily store a month’s work of meat and frozen veg.

Then after 7 months of use, in April 2014, the machine stopped working. I went away to a relatives on Friday night and returned on the Sunday to find the machine silent.
I opened the fridge to find it warm, and smelly – food was rotting. I opened the freezer to find it barely cold, and the meat had thawed out. All that food had to be thrown out. I wasn’t happy. I contacted the seller, who passed me onto Zanussi.
The machine has a 12-month warranty, and so an engineer came out a couple of days later. He repaired the machine within about an hour, and essentially ‘re-gassed’ the appliance. A few hours later it was all back up and running, and I could get about re-stocking it with food. All was fine.

It turned one year old in September 2014, and so the warranty expired.

At the end of November 2014, at 14 months old, I returned from a couple of nights away. It was Sunday afternoon and I returned to find machine has stopped working again. This is 7 month after the initial repair. I wasn’t happy, and also very aware that the warranty had expired.
As with the first failure, the machine was silent. Once again, the fridge was warm (warmer than the actual kitchen) and stinky. And once again, the freezer was full of thawed meat, and warm, too. And once again I threw away a lot of spoiled food.

I contacted Zanussi on the Monday morning. During that day, I made three phone-calls (each lasting around 30 minutes). I explained the problem, and was advised that an out-of-warranty service would be £115. I refused to pay this given the age of the machine, and the fact it had already failed once before. I asked to speak to someone about a replacement machine, and was advised I’d be called back. This happened for the first two phone-calls – as nobody returned my call.
The third call was pretty much the same, expect this time it was 5.15pm and most of the office had left for the day. I was given the Customer Care email address and advised to write in.

So, that Monday evening I emailed the Zanussi/Electrolux Customer Care department and explained exactly what had happened. I also sent this email to my local Euronics store as well as the main Euronics customer service email.

A week has no passed, and it’s early December (writing this review on 6th December).
In that time I have not had any response from Zanussi, nothing from Euronics, and one call from my local Euronics store that have supposedly contacted Zanussi themselves. I even contacted Zanussi UK via Facebook and Twitter, who have simply passed my contact details to the Customer care team.

Having spent over £400 on an appliance, I would expect it to last well beyond 14 months. (My previous fridge-freezer was a Hotpoint, cost £400, and lasted me 3 years before I sold it with my flat to the new owner.)
I appreciate that machines do fail, and that is why we have warranty periods, but the value of the product also implies its quality. This machine hasn’t lived up to its retail value.
Also, given the age of the appliance, the customer should not be willing to pay out £115 to repair a fault that has occurred twice. In both cases I’ve been forced to throw away food that was never reimbursed, so why should I keep losing money for a faulty product?

The appalling level of customer service is simply unprofessional. I find it infuriating that customers can be treated this way – if I treated customers in this manner, I would be fired with immediate effect.

So, given my rant, do I recommend this machine? No.
Would I look at buying anything from Zanussi again? No.

Stay away from this product, and possibly any fridge-freezer produced by Zanussi, unless you really like throwing money away and receiving the worst possible customer experience.",Rejected
"The bin is a little awkward to attach / detach and emptying is messy. The machine falls over far too easily (yes, I know it can be parked on the charger but this isn't always convenient and this too can be fiddly).",Approved

"The oven does the business, still getting use to the various modes available. The variety of rings on the Hob are certainly useful and clean easily.",Approved
"The metal grill on the hob is of poor design and pans are unstable unless very carefully placed. Have had many near misses and have to warn houseguests in order to avoid accidents.

Am hoping I can buy a different design of metal grill, otherwise I will have to replace the whole hob.

I have had many Zanussi products over the years and found them to be well made, robust and practical, so this fault in design is rather a shock. It has not deterred me from buying Zanussi products, just will be more cautious.",Rejected
It looks fine and seems to do the job OK. Not too happy with the edges where the upper and lower chimneys slide in. The top fixing to the bracket seems over fiddly. I feel the vented offering would benefit from a grease filter and not just the wire mesh filter as the extraction tube and inner workings will soon become clogged with grease.,Approved
"The continuous steam feature is too easily operated and can cause a scalding. I have had to tape the continuous steam feature off to prevent inadvertent operation.
The emptying of the water holding tank is cumbersome. The whole appliance has to be turned upside down to remove the excess water.
The actual ironing action is very good and the the whole appliance is safe to carry away after use.",Rejected
"I was looking for my first washing machine for my my first house ,yes there was a lot of choices so why this? I liked the pre mix feature I've never seen another make that does this and I actually believe in the concept of mix it first then in to the drum . I've also never seen the water softener feature in any other make , having now used both these features I believe it adds to the experience of keeping my clothes looking the best they can . Yes it's quite expensive as washing machines go but I found the machine to be very quiet although mine is in a washroom I'm sure even in an open plan kitchen it wouldn't be to intrusive, I have tried various programs and have found them varied from long to short but found what ever program I used it washed my clothes I had an excellent result. The quality is top notch and I would expect it to last me years . The computer is very responsive and basically looks after it's self once you have chosen your program although the start button is very sensitive and can accidentally be pressed .Overall it's very quite very well made looks good and washed excellent ... so did I make the right choice ..... definitely",Approved
"i love the lower setting to cook pizza, the kids now have crispy bases. The top oven is good for Smaller things i.e fishfinger.

"We were getting a new kitchen so thought we would splash out on a bit of luxury. This washing machine looks smart and stylish, it adds a touch of glamour to any kitchen. First thing which is noticeable is the LCD display which is clear and easy to set with lots of different settings. The drum is large and can easily take a full family load of washing. The machine is incredibly quiet even when spinning the clothes you can converse normally whilst it is on. Overall this is a lovely machine that is well worth the money.",Approved
"If AEG 9000 series 1600 spin was a car it would have been a BMW! AEG bring style in looks to your kitchen,Then there’s the light inside...no more socks left inside! It’s quiet,oko mix powerful cleaning in less than an hour,I must remember to use lots less powder because of the clever pre-mixing system! What a 1st class quality item, if your looking for quality and style, you might as well save time and head straight for AEG, that reminds me time saver programme awesome not 1 but 2 extra time reductions for many programmes. Was I surprised how good it was,.... yes I was amazed would have been the words....but I shouldn’t have been ... it won the red dot design award. simple,awesome design,packed with features....maybe it should have been an A.E.G.....well it is!

I think my only criticism is that there isn't a quick programme. I love the open door feature at the end of the programme.,Approved
"I am a bloke living on my own so, I can't be fussed about sorting my washing into whatever category it falls in. This machine works out how much washing I put in and adjusts the washing time accordingly. The soft water technology is so gentle on my clothes that even I have noticed a difference. Even my socks are easier to put on because they are soft and stretchy as opposed to hard and tight when washed with previous machines I have had. And this machine is so quiet! The first few times I used it, I had to keep going out to the kitchen to see if it was still on because I couldn't hear it. I wouldn't normally get excited about a domestic appliance but this machine suits me perfectly. Brilliant.",Approved
"This was a replacement for a 15-year old AEG Lavamat which had done sterling service. This new machine is incredibly quiet and sturdily built. It has preset programmes but you can modify them easily in terms of time taken, spin speed, temperature etc. meaning that you have total control over your washing. I'm afraid I'm not one for washing clothes for 2 1/2 hours (unless on Eco mode, of course) and I am getting great results by using the Time Reduce function. I love the way the machine mixes the washing liquid and fabric conditioner before with water before introducing it to the drum. I'm very very pleased with my purchase and glad I stuck with AEG (this is my third).",Approved
Features seems back to front to me eg gas rings turn anti clockwise for full flame. Oven cooks evenly and stays clean. I've purchased the Aeg cleaner to ensure my cooker stays protected and looking good for as long as possible.,Approved
Very pleased with my new product. Easy to use and practical features making life so much easier.,Approved
"Good sides: 
- Drier consumes less energy compared to conventional driers 
- Great water and energy economy 
- Quality wash and spin
- It's exceptionally quiet even during spin stage
- In case you have forgotten something, you can add more clothes by pressing start/pause, when the water level is low - the hatch will unlock, otherwise it will stay locked 
- Looks like a piece of art

Drawbacks:
- Wash duration isn't that accurate most of the time by approximately 30 minutes. Most notably during the spin phase where it would show 25 min. remaining, after 25 real minutes have passed it would show 20 minutes remaining 
- The drier is relatively noisy, I would not use it during the night 
- The touch interface would not always detect touches, or sometimes it will detect a single touch as 2 taps",Approved
This oven has some great features but there are some things that could do with improving. The shelves are designed to be a safety feature but this does not work although the lip on the shelf does stop any items from sliding off the shelf it also makes it difficult to take out items as you have to lift them over the lip and if it is a baking tray it is hard to get a hold of it. You are also limited as to where you can position the shelves as they have to be put on the sliding bars also a handle for the grill pan would be useful,Approved
"We don't have a lot of space so getting a washer-dryer combo was necessary. This model is perfect because it has high capacity, washes everything really well, dries the clothes excellently and they come out wothout wrinkles, just waiting to be folded in the wardrobe. It does cost twice as most of the other models, but it's worth it.",Approved
"The icons printed on the knobs are hard to identify due to the small size and lack contrast being black on grey. They are not easy to select if you are (a) short (b) forgot your glasses. Would be better with a rotary dial. The grill pan does not come with a handle of any sort, so burns and accidents are likely through using whatever is to hand. The grill needs the temperature setting set to max as well as the half or full grill setting. Pointless.",Approved
"Very smart, high quality & practical. Excellent results so far although, blurb states a super fast grill - don't find it so, rather slow at heating up. Control markings not the most ergonomic.",Approved
"This is a lovely oven I love it bakes my cakes to perfection.
So easy to set up the timer.",Approved
"Nice looking double oven with grill ! Good for families and also for couples.
Easy to keep clean! The features are easy to use once you have got use to them. Instructions for use of both ovens at the same time - are not available in the manual - thankfully the fitter explained how to do this",Approved
"Bought this machine as tired of buying cheap machines that break after a year ,so far this machine has been a treat to use and is very quiet the program times aren't to bad either and the spin cycle really drys the clothes well the quick wash is great aswell",Approved
"We had a faulty coffee machine, I received an excellent service from your customer service team and we are enjoying coffee in our new coffee machine, compared to our previous machine the coffee is really hot which we really like.",Approved
"Sadly this oven has been marred by the fact that the element for the top oven was not working from the start. Sadly still not resolved - I would've really expected a new unit if it's not a quick fix - which it seems it isn't.

That aside, after getting used to the controls, it's been good. It would be nice to have the option to set the default turn on temperature, and swap between the running time and oven current temperature as permanent option - which you would've though would be simple to implement. A bit tricky to cancel a timer too.

It heats quickly and in fact shows it's fairly well insulated as takes a long time to cool.",Approved
"Having used several ""traditional"" espresso machines over the years, I finally took the plunge and bought a capsule machine recently. Why I didn't take the plunge (no pun intended) earlier, I'll never know. This is just the easiest, most compact and stylish bit of kit ever. With a choice of ten different Lavazza coffee blends available (I know, a bit too much choice), everyone should find one to suit their taste. For me, the stand out features are: ease of use, speed from switching on and, most important of all, pretty much foolproof. I can honestly say the end product is as good as any espresso/americano I've ever tasted. The only downside is a lack of a steamer if you prefer your coffee frothy. The upside is a crema on your espresso a barista would be proud of. Five stars from me!",Approved
A really good piece of kit which easy to use and fully meets the functions required in our kitchen,Approved
I like the fact that the spinner can go at 1400 revs,Approved
This is the best cooker I've had for a good few years. Really pleased with it. The only thing is the steam from the main oven only come out of one of the vents so when you open the door the steam hits you.,Approved
"I purchased one of these machines two years four months ago, from John Lewis. At the time the cost was £170 although it is now available for considerably less. It makes good Lavazza espresso (much better than the fairly poor AEG Espria which we have unfortunately now replaced the Favola with) but it has been very unreliable. I returned the machine to AEG under warranty after fourteen months because it was producing massive amounts of waste water on every use and was leaving tiny metallic traces in the cup when using the hot water nozzle. The machine was repaired free of charge. During the second year the 'pod lever' became a little stiff at times, this eventually ended up with the piston that spikes the pod breaking completely, making the machine unusable after only two years and four months. It was out of warranty, AEG were not interested and referred us to their repair agents, who can fix the problem for £55. All in all, as far as quality goes, the machine's looks far exceed it's reliability. Think carefully about buying this product if you want a coffee machine that lasts for a reasonable amount of time.",Rejected
Superb quality fridge but when you try to get information or help via service back-up or from the product description on the web site there is absolutely no response.,Approved
Have found no faults with this ovan everything worked fine first time instruction book not too bad,Approved
"I purchased this coffee machine in August 2012.. The design is attractive and it makes excellent coffee. However, my particular machine suffered from two faults and is now unusable. After twelve months the machine was producing huge amounts of waste water and metallic traces could be seen in the water after any use of the milk frothing pipe. This was repaired under warranty. After two years and four months the piston that pierces the coffee pods with spikes broke completely at the pod end and the machine is out of warranty. I have had to buy a replacement machine. Good looks, good coffee but based on my experience I don't recommend this machine.",Approved
"Very easy to use coffee machine using one-use capsules. Good selection of coffee blends in Lavazzo range, however there is only one recyclable capsule which does not appear to be readily available. Local (Guildford, Surrey, UK) Tesco has three options on their shelf.

Quick and easy to use and, when used in conjunction with milk heater/frother produces a nice cup. Two temperature settings are available, however I've only used the higher setting during this winter period. If a warmer cup of coffee is required it is necessary to pre-heat the cup, however this is still warm rather than hot. (could put drink in microwave cooker to heat if required)

Only issues are:
(i) Lack of recyclable capsules and
(ii) Hot setting not provided.",Rejected
"After initially not being able to use touch screen heat controls, watch u-tube guide which made everything clear. Now operating exactly as I had hoped.Temperature very easy to set and seems to be accurate. Induction system is a revelation after using halogen cooker for 10 years.

The only negative ! The timer beep is very quite.",Approved
"For years I used a home espresso machine - the cup-on-arm variety. When that finally began to fail, I thought hard about switching to a pod-based coffee maker. Choosing Lavazza over Nespresso, I then picked out the AEG Lavazza Modo Mio machine. I am very pleased with the result. I have better coffee to drink at home than most cafes serve. The machine is very simple to use, and to clean. Pods can be found online (in bulk) cheaper than in the supermarkets. There are no coffee grounds to clear-up or to dispose of - used pods go in the waste bin. If you really like coffee, you will like Lavazza, and this machine makes a great cup of their coffee.",Approved
"Really pleased with this machine - well made, nice and small but makes great coffee, so all the things we really wanted. The water tank is quite large so not too many refills. Why not 5 stars - niggles are with the longest drink it’s only 1/2 a small mug. I get the expressio thing but I end up running it twice or boiling the kettle. It is quite easy to adjust the water on each of the modes. The only other thing is it’s electronic but doesn’t have any “safety” cut outs so you can run it dry and it doesn’t stop, and run it without locking it shut, both of which cause it to make a terrible noise. Okay user error but would be better if it didn’t. Even with this I’d buy it again. The coffee isn’t too expensive and you can normally get a deal to get it to 20p a pod.",Approved
"First machine was leaking from the bottom where the power cord was coming out of the machine. This was even with the water tank empty, clearly not sealed correctly inside. Swapped for a new machine, this one didn’t even come with the water tank in the box. Took that back for a new machine and this one suffers from the same leak as the first one. Unbelievable. After googling for reviews of this machine it seems like a common problem. Taking back for a full refund. Would be such a good machine if it weren’t for the terrible build quality.",Approved
"Bought as a viable alternative to a ""bean to cup"" coffee machine.
The demo in John Lewis was good but obviously I was distracted by the sales pitch.
The machine takes forever to make a cup of coffee and even after assigning quantity amounts to the led's they do not comply.
I was also told that Lavazza were bringing out a pod storage rack - they are not apparently.
I was also told I could purchase a cream coloured milk frother online - not made in that colour apparently.
If I lived closer to where I purchased, 3 hour round trip, I would have returned the unit.",Rejected
"This product is very good, compact coffee machine BUT my item had a short working life (less than 1 year). I used water from bootles (not tap water) with lower carbon content, regularly did descaling but anyway coffee machine started malfunction - The coffee preparation process stops immediately after the start and hangs. The only way is to turn it off and then turn it on and proceed in this way several times to finish the coffee preparation. Only about 10% of the cases go through a full cycle without malfunction. The machine does not have any lime deposits, I guess the fault is software problems. I suggest manufacturer to add function to reset a machine to default values.",Approved
My wife says this works well and it is significantly quieter than our last drier!,Approved
"This is a dryer that doesn't actually dry anything. It looks great, and looks like it has lots of features, but the main feature, which is to dry the items you put in, doesn't do what it says. Everythihg I have put in this dryer has come out damp - despite re-putting it in on the 'extra dry' setting, it makes no difference. It uses just a luke warm heat instead of a hot heat, and unless you press the anti-crease button, it finishes it's cycle with a cool air - nicely setting the creases into clothes - I mean why does a dryer need to have an anti-crease setting - who really wants their clothes/sheets etc to not be as crease-free as possible? I am so disappointed in this dryer, I would strongly recommend anyone not to buy it.",Approved
"Having an oven door which was only half connected to the oven was not good, not being able to close it was worse [my kitchen is narrow and it was dangerously obstructive] but work of all was calling Service and finding that the soonest they could offer a visit was 10 days away! And as I would be away from home on that day I had to wait 2 weeks in all. The engineer who called was excellent in every way but it was a long time with the inconvenience of a broke oven.",Rejected

Simple to use and easy to clean. So glad I went with AEG,Approved
"Bought for my new kitchen. Smaller inside than my undercounter fridge it does seem to get filled quickly. Think it has one shelf less.

Salad drawer gets a lot of condensation so need to keep an eye on it. The part that is meant to hold things in door spent more time on floor as it couldn't cope with 4pt bottles milk. Easier without.

Quiet (so far) and will be interested to see how it manages once integrated.",Approved
"After a lot of research I desided on the AEG due to the size of the ovens, the power and being able to have all the hob rings on full power, the easey layout of the controls and the self cleaning, this is a fab unit.",Approved
I love this oven it’s very easy to use and cooks evenly and most of all easy to clean !,Approved
"Nice design and glass shelves allow you to see easily what is on each shelf. Plenty of storage space.
Only downside is that the plastic retainer for smaller bottles keeps coming off, although this doesn't really detract from using the bottle shelf on the door.
All in all very pleased with this product.",Approved
Looks good in our new kitchen. Well worth the money,Approved
"This fridge is huge. It is very good apart from a badly designed door! If you open the door wide, it slowly closes, which is a good thing in terms of not walking away and leaving it open, but really annoying when you are trying to fill it up after the weekly shop. Also the handle feels flimsy and I am guessing will come loose fairly soon and need refixing or replacing. Not good on a fridge costing £329.",Rejected
AEG Make the difference in everything. I'm proud because I bought from they.,Approved
"This unit is marketed as a built in unit for eye level height use. 
The user manual clearly states it is a built under unit.
If fixed at eye level height the controls are virtually impossible to set due to the lack of facia numbering  unless users were 7 feet tall to enable correct reading of the side numbered knobs. 
I have not tried using the unit due to this distinct design flaw. I would also like point out the lack of  self clean features.",Approved
"I have three pod coffee machines, Nespresso Inissia, Dolce Gusto Jovia & Lavazza Magia, & all are used regularly. They all make good coffee but I would say that the Lavazza makes the best. (Note: It was also the most expensive of the three!)

 I like the higher temperature option & now notice how lukewarm the coffee from the other machines is. 
I usually have a latte - probably the temperature is not an issue if you prefer coffee without milk.

I have enjoyed all the Lavazza coffees tried so far (the sample pack & a large variety pack bought from Amazon covered most of them) & particular favourites are Delizioso & Tierra.

Setting up & understanding the machine was quite easy - the pod ejection mechanism is a little hesitant , maybe, compared with the Inissia but acceptable. I do like the Lavazza's large capsule holder.

The pods are certainly not as easy to come by as Dolce Gusto, & not many varieties are stocked in supermarkets. However, prices tend to be more reasonable than for Nespresso & Dolce Gusto & that is true of online prices, eg Amazon, too. If you want lots & lots of choice of flavours, go for Nespresso, but the Lavazza tastes more like proper coffee to me.

The water tank is a decent size though not the easiest to manoeuvre & fill if the machine is located in a tight space - a hook to lift it out would help.

So, all in all, I like the Lavazza Magia very much. It looks good, the coffee is excellent, & it performs exactly as I'd hoped.",Approved
"very pleased with this washing machine, love the delay start button, this enables me to set it before i go to bed ,9 hours ahead and its all done in the morning, or, at least just finishing when i get up, would be very good for all electric properties that have to work off of economy 7 times.
good short programmes too and love the ;quick wash;
I have always had bosh machines but due to the price of this one I choose this instead,
good choice,! very pleased with it!",Approved
I've always loved Lavazza coffee made with my trusty Classic Gaggia so when I visited my sister who had this AEG Lavazza machine I was sceptical. The no fuss pods made an espresso just as good if not better. I immediately bought one. It is super easy to use and very little cleaning required to keep it looking fab. It's very stylish too. The milk function really works well and makes a lovely froth if you prefer cappuccino. I even mad a mocha for a friend who said it was great. The iced coffee function has been really good for the summer too. A perfect addition for my kitchen.,Approved
The design is first class and the quality of the coffee is all one would wish. I enjoy using it.,Approved

"I was bought this coffee machine for Christmas. I love that it has the milk frother with it, although it is tight to fit onto the machine and you feel like it will break every time you try to push it into place (hence the 3 stars for quality).
The coffee selections that you receive with the machine are great and I have found my favourites now. The coffee amounts that come out are too small. You select a large cup, but not much comes out - I have to press again for a decent size cup of coffee. If you had more than two people waiting for a coffee, it would take a long time. It would be best for a single person or couple.",Approved
Would recommend to all family and friends I have been very pleased with this item,Approved
The kettle is efficient. It has a sturdy appearance and is easy to use. I expect it will last many years. Thankyou,Approved
"I love my new coffee machine 
There is a lot of choice of pods to choose from but they are only coffee pods. No hot chocolate or other drinks. 
Where it makes up for choice is in the milk frother. With it it makes awsome latte and Cappuccinos, you can do hot chocolate by just adding it to the milk in the frother and my daughter loves it and it also makes cold drinks as Well like milkshake and iced coffee. 
I really recommend this machine as the Lavazza coffee taste so much better than the other coffee pod machines out there.",Approved
"Does everything it says on the tin & then some. Boils rapidly, like the 1 cup option which boils a cup of water very quickly. Still to use warming & custom settings, but very happy with purchase.",Approved

"I bought this machine 20 months ago, it stopped working after 6 months, a replacement circuit board was put in, it stopped again 1 month after the warranty expired, i was told the condenser had too be replaced and I could either pay that cost approx £350 or join the repair scheme for £160 which I did. At this time the machine was approx 14 months old. I have struggled since then to actually dry my clothes on any setting, for example my bedclothes are cotton and polyester mix superking/fitted sheet/7 pillowcases. this machine has never, since day one dried this set, on any setting. ie cotton/syn/mix/quarter/half/full sun. I have 1 month of my repair policy left and they are arguing that it is my fault and I do not understand the machine, yet your advert stated ""It is easy, no more guess work",Approved

this easy to use machine has settings to cover any kind of wash.It is quiet and holds a good large amount.it is very smooth running,Approved
"So far, so good. It is taking a pounding from the family, but is up to the task. My only slight gripe is it takes a little while for the beeping to stop when it has finished its cycle.",Approved
"If ever there were a case for reading reviews before you buy this would be it. Everything that is written above is absolutely true.

To summarise my experience:

1. a standard dinner service plate does not fit in as it is too big and prevents the ""whirly thing"" from going round because the top tray is too low. (Actually that's not quite true - you can fit two plates in, one in each corner, so you can in fact 'wash' two plates at a time);

2. Tumblers and glasses fall over on the top shelf and fill with water - I have no idea what the shelf is designed for, but nothing I own can sensibly stand up in it;

3. Most things don't really get cleaned - you put them in dirty and they come out slightly wetter and still dirty. My old dishwasher used to dry things so they came out hot and dry. It seems this one isn't even designed to do that;

4. Mine was fitted about 4 months ago, but the top shelf already regularly falls off its runners so it gets stuck when you try and push the draw in and out. This would be quite frustrating, but I have come to accept it as a amusing quirk in a sea of incredulity.

In case you are wondering why I bought it - I am too. The truth is we were having a fitted kitchen put in by Magnet and amongst all the other decisions, I thought this one quite an easy one. I figured that pretty much all dishwashers were the same, and they only seemed to stock those from the Electrolux stable. I thought AEG was the Electrolux 'premium' brand, so I went with that.

Just disappointed with myself for not paying more attention to researching before I buy. .",Approved
"A very quiet dishwasher which produces fabulous cleaning results. Programmes are a bit long, but this is due to the pump being designed to turn very slowly so that the machine uses very little electricity. Recommended.",Approved
"When I initially looked at the cooker it looked really complicated after about 20 minutes I’d worked out most of its features.
It’s been a great replacement for my old halogen cooker and far easier to keep clean.",Approved
"The ovens and hobs heat up really quickly. Useful features although still finding out how to work some of them!

"This is a lovely powerful hoover and so light to use yet picks bits up easily and you can choose different settings.

I would especially recommend this product to anyone who has problems with their wrists as my mum has arthritis in both wrists and yet can easily use this hoover.",Approved
"Two immediate problems on purchase -

1. Suction so powerful that in places it lifted my carpet and stuck it to the machine, with resultant slow down of motor. Easily sorted - you just turn the big knob halfway up the machine, and bleed off as much air as you want to the hosepipe.

2. On medium pile setting, did not pick up threads etc. But brush much too fierce on low setting. Needed something in between. So I removed the yellow adjusting knob and filed down the unused back, so that I now have an inclined plane to give me infinitely variable pitch. I left the original hills and valleys to use in original positions.",Approved
"This cooker has put the pleasure back into my cooking. Love the fast response of the induction hob, the ovens heat up quickly, and are easy to keep clean.",Approved
"This cleaner is OK but for the poor flexible hose which is too stiff and does not stretch. Eventually it buckles and collapses under the suction of the machine and you have to buy a new one which costs about a third of the price of a new machine.

If you buy a replacement hose it is a proper stretchy hose which will withstand the suction. If you approach Zanussi/Electrolux about this issue they just say that in their judgement the hose as supplied is OK but they clearly know it is not otherwise why would the replacement spare part be of a better quality.

It is very disappointing that a large multinational such as Electrolux/Zanussi are so unresponsive to customer feedback but I am afraid it is all to typical of today's commercial world.",Rejected
"So my sister bought this vacuum and as stated on other reviews it is a very good, light vacuum......so, I bought myself the same one. 
One of the inside wheels fell off of my sisters vacuum, we decided to attach it with a screw, (after sawing the head off the screw)this worked fine. Not many weeks later the other inner wheel broke, same thing, the small plastic bar holding it in place snapped, another headless screw needed. the final straw was when a back wheel broke off, at this point she gave up and purchased a different one. Mine, well after 12 weeks one of my inner wheels did exactly the same, so needless to say I've returned it to Tesco. the person we spoke to at Zanussi implied it was my fault if I couldn't put the wheel back on because i had broken the small plastic bar! Thank you to Tesco for my refund. Black mark for Zanussi man!",Rejected

this item is as good as a chest freezer which we had before because with the drawers you can allocate certain foods to certain drawers whereas with the chest freezer you have to stack food on top of each other,Approved
The cooker looks very nice however the help from AEG support is RUBBISH sent 4 emails requesting help and only 1 reply 2 weeks was after 1st request,Approved

"Bought this oven through Coop Electrical who were extremely good and very helpful .Unfortunately the oven itself is not very good, we assumed that as the grill was gas it would be adjustable but no its either on or off don't know why , ok so you can adjust the grill pan up or down but it cooks too quickly (Pork chops on level 2 as suggested in owners manual burnt on the outside in ten minutes ) The grill pan is too big and heavy and needs a removable handle so you can pull it out to check without having to try and grip a thin edge with oven gloves, it also gets stuck in the runners too easily .Had to buy a smaller grill pan with handle. We have found that although the manual states to hold the ignition knob down for up to 15 seconds which in itself is miles too long, it actually takes 20 plus seconds. The door is so delicate that it puts the flame out with the slightest touch either up or down and the flame goes out for no good reason anyway. Should have kept our old 15 year Cannon with the eye level grill which was so much better.in all ways.",Approved
"We replaced an aging NEF dishwasher because it could not be repaired. We expected good service from our new AEG product, but our expectations have been blown away. The new dishwasher washes much quieter and much more completely in a much shorter time. Additional features including the red and green lights that shine on the floor to indicate the status of the wash are great and make us very pleased that we chose the best product.",Approved
"This cooker looked so beautiful, the burners worked well, and the top oven/grill wasn't too bad, a little slower than hoped for, and the grill cannot be controlled which is a shame. However, nothing prepared me for how slow the main cooker was. The main problem appears to be that the main oven needs to be preheated for a full 20 minutes during which the flame cannot be controlled. After that time, when the ""normal"" temperature is reached, it can be varied up and down. However, after the preheat time the oven regularly takes twice as long as any cooker I have previously used to cook, chilled chicken burgers packet says 25 minutes, this cooker took 1 hour 25 minutes including preheat. I assumed there was a fault. However, the engineer called out said the cooker reached the required temperature and refused to investigate further so I had to sustain a financial loss with AO by buying a different cooker, would never buy another Zanussi product again. I wonder if there was a fault or whether this model does not adequately circulate the heat around the oven chamber and is therefore ineffective.",Rejected
Can’t fault the wash and features but the drying isn’t fantastic and the unit itself just feels a bit flimsy compared to my last unit which was a Siemens.,Approved
"We have had the machine for just over 1 month and are pretty happy with our purchase.  Everything gets cleaned very well first time and so we don't have to re-wash anything by hand.  The machine is quiet and the design is good, which is not always the case with freestanding dishwashers.  I am a little concerned about the door opening mechanism and how that will perform over the life of the machine but at the moment all is ok.",Approved
"I like the design of this machine very much, The huge water tank (in comparison to my last A Modo Mio machine) is a real boon as I'm not constantly refilling it.
The milk jug frother has been upgraded since my last machine and there are now options for large, regular and small amounts of froth for your latte/cappucino which do work very well. Unfortunately the design of the just has changed slightly therefore I couldn't use the old jug as a spare. The touch panel buttons are a nice addition also (can at times be too sensitive) but nothing much to worry about. It delivers a great cup of coffee, espresso or otherwise which you can't fault.
Whilst this doesn't get a ful 5 star rating in each category though is due to a few minor points. No temperature control on this model and no low water warning either which would be a real help as I'm now out of the habit of checking all time due to the large capacity tank. Finally, as with my last machine, the pod eject system never works properly unless you eject the pod immediately after using it, and even then it sometimes sticks. I generally leave the pod in place until I go to make my next cup of coffee and 99% of the time the old pod will remain in place and I'll have to forcefully eject it with my finger. Don't let this put you off buying an otherwise great piece of kit. I got mine on Amazon for £126 and just noticed today that it's jumped up to £160 mark",Rejected
"When our ageing Hotpoint dishwasher finally gave up the ghost after 15 years service and we invested in a new AEG model, we discovered we'd been living with a really, really poor machine for years! We thought it was normal to have to re-wash some items by hand, after they'd been in the dishwasher. We thought it was normal for glasses to look lacklustre after washing and normal for things not to dry properly. Buying this new AEG has been a game changer, seriously!",Approved
"Having previously had an earlier model of this dishwasher the top rack in this latest model is disappointing in that the loading of glasses and mugs is less easy. This apart the overall performance, particularly the 30 minute programme, is excellent",Approved
WE called out the engineer after 5 months thinking that the product was no good to find out that the heater had not worked since day one due to an open circuit it is now working OK but yo should look at your testing Schedule,Approved
"Had the cooker for just over 2 months. Just had to call the engineers out because of 3 minor faults. 1- the oven makes a loud popping noise all the time it's working. 2- the timer alarm was so weak you could only hear it if in the kitchen. 3- some rubber feet on the pan supports were missing. The engineer told us the popping noise is normal , changed the alarm which is now a lot louder and put some new rubber feet on. With regards to the design I feel the main burner should be at the back of the hob as on other stoves I have owned",Approved
"Just totally love my new oven it’s amazing, so recommend this *****",Approved
"This dishwasher is so quiet that the only way I know it is on is the time beam on the floor. So great for an open plan kitchen, dining & living area. Also, the way it pops open at the end of the cycle. And of course, the comfort lift!!!",Approved
I find this cooker a bit slower than my old one but still very nice to use. It has taken a while to get used to the differences. I would have preferred to have 3 rings of the same size and one large one. I find the smallest a bit too slow but that maybe me! Also the grill-pan is too large for just the two of us but brilliant for a large family. maybe a smaller alternative could also be included? I have got over this by placing a small tin inside the tray and covering it in foil. This saves me having to wash the large tray every time I use it. I like the large size of the top oven very handy for two people.,Approved
"This product is very light and very easy to push.
The only problem the pipe on the tools is a bit short especially on the stairs.
Easy to empty.
Overall a good powerful cleaner.",Approved
"The design and features are good but the quality is poor..the grill stops working whilst cooking you have to keep relighting it. The pan holder grids are loosing their enamel paint..I now need an engineer as the electrics are not working, which means the main oven and hob I have had to light manually..and now the main oven stops working whilst cooking is in progress and I have to relight it..this product has only been used for two people and only 5 days a week..out of 15months the cooker has only been used regularly for say 11months due to staying with our family.",Approved

It was easy to install and the fan is quieter than expected. The lighting was one of the main features that decided the purchase. So very pleased with the purchase.,Approved
"First AEG dishwasher we have had. Layout seems good easy to maintain salt etc and washes very well.
Bit dissappointed with the programs which are short or long two hours plus needs some in between options.
Overall very pleased and would recommend.",Approved
"I like the design of this machine very much, The huge water tank (in comparison to my last a Modo Mio machine) is a real boon as I'm not constantly refilling it. The milk jug frother has been upgraded since my last machine and there are now options for large, regular and small amounts of froth for your latte/cappuccino which do work very well. Unfortunately the design of the jug has changed slightly therefore I couldn't use the old jug as a spare. The touch panel buttons are a nice addition also (can at times be too sensitive) but nothing much to worry about. It delivers a great cup of coffee, espresso or otherwise which you can't fault. This doesn't get a full 5 star rating in each category though due to a few minor points. No temperature control on this model and no low water warning either which would be a real help as I'm now out of the habit of checking the water level regularly due to the large capacity tank. Finally, as with my last machine, the pod eject system never works properly unless you eject the pod immediately after using it, and even then it sometimes sticks. I generally leave the pod in place until I make my next cup of coffee and 99% of the time the old pod will remain in place and I'll have to forcefully eject it with my finger. Don't let this put you off buying an otherwise great piece of kit. In terms of value for money it is difficult to comment as I have seen the machine vary in price by approx 30%.",Approved
"The machine looks great, sadly the looks don't match its function quality. A very noisy to start with and little less throughout the process of making coffee wakes up the whole household in the morning. Water tank leaked on a couple of occasions, but I think it needed its adjusting period, Im watching it still. Not too big capsule bin must be emptied frequently but I suppose its the compact size of the machine that limits it. Had better expectations for what it costs, overrated on the whole. Coffee tastes good though but I think its the Brazilian beans so nothing to do with the machine.",Approved
"Great features, easy to use and the bonus is a great tasting coffee",Approved
"Great design and functions. Early days, but can feel the quality of the product.",Approved
If I have a complaint it’s that it’s much more noisy than my previous Bosch,Approved
First time we have bought a AEG have to say it looks stylish has very good energy ratings and the controls are easy to read and use.,Approved
A bit pricey but we bought it because we were in the market for a quality freestanding freezer with good practical design in terms of drawers. Particularly like the drawers which pull out smoothly and have end stops.,Approved
EASY TO OPERATE.WARNING SOUND AT END OF CYCLE VERY USEFUL.,Approved
"The AEG Lavazza Fantasia Plus was a gift from my wife. Bought in mid September 2018 from John Lewis. After 2 days of use the Fantasia started to leak water from the base of the unit. JL were great and swapped it for an identical machine. 2 weeks later exactly the same fault, water leaking from the machine at the base. I've either been very unlucky and had two faulty machines from the same batch or there is a design flaw that AEG need to address. On the basis of my experience I cannot recommend this coffee machine. I've now taken the 2nd unit back to JL and they have swapped it to a machine from Dualit.",Rejected
"Clear simple controls and pleasingly quiet in operation. Quality finish and performance, the ""time save"" feature is particularly welcome.",Approved
Far to heavy and doesn't pick up very well.pushes bits around not practically.,Approved
"This machine is much quieter than our previous Whirlpool and spins drier too.

Like other makes, some programmes can take a long time but the delay feature and the ""time to wash"" indicator help to manage these aspects so I can have clothes finished when it best suits me.

The quality of the machine appears to be good - I have managed an appliance repair business so have some expertise in this area.

The clincher in deciding to buy this AEG was the free five year warranty - it worked out much cheaper than buying a budget brand machine for around £200 and then paying extra for the extended warranty.",Rejected
"I bought this cooker to replace one that I'd had for 20+ years. On the whole I'm very pleased with it. It takes a little bit of getting used to because the gas on the hob comes on at the highest point and has to be turned down, rather than the opposite way on my last cooker.

I love the double oven and enormous capacity. I've got a large family and this really does make it easier to get a roast dinner on the table to feed everyone.

One tray comes with the cooker and I have found this is really only for use in the largest lower oven. It will fit in the top oven/grill but you have to remove the shelf and then there's no where to put the shelf until you return it afterwards. The tray acts as a shelf in itself and doesn't fit on the other shelves as they have a piece of metal at the back edge that acts as a stop. I therefore use my old grill pan which works perfectly well in the top oven/grill.

The one strange thing I have found is that the grill seems to have a bit of a gap in the middle and so you must carefully position bread on the outer edges for it to toast evenly. Sausages and fish fingers all grill nicely as long as you position them under the gas jets.",Approved
Great looking design at a very affordable price. Purchased to match our oven and hob. Simple to operate and easy to clean. Would highly recommend.,Approved
Did get caught out by liquid soap going strait through and causing patched bleeching when using a delayed start !,Approved

"For the stairs and small areas this is ideal. The drawback is that it’s very noisy and heavy and if you are elderly like myself, makes it difficult to hold comfortably.",Approved
Does a brilliant job better suction than larger uprights.gets up the smallest bits of fluff that are stuck to the carpet,Approved
Pleasing to the eye and it provides us with all the functionality we require.,Approved

I find the bottom oven very small so need to use top oven along with bottom oven. Oslo disappointed that grill did not come with a handle. I think this should be part of oven. I think oven gives good heating and equal heat just wish it was better proportioned,Approved
"Love the features of the machine especially the steam function and super fast 1600 spin which cuts down on drying time, added to that the manufacturers 5 year warranty which makes this machine excellent value if spread over the lifetime, hence the title.",Approved

This is a sturdy product and the layout makes it easy for pans to be side by side unlike some other hobs (where pans are too close). Only reason it didn't get a 5 is it's quite easily marked and difficult to keep clean,Approved

Excellent freezer. Good sized drawers so can freeze lots of stuff. Handy little pull out tray at bottom for ice cubes. Would highly recommend.,Approved

"Well made, well designed. Super capacity, great for our busy household. Cottons wash is sooo long so I'm tending to use the synthetics for most washes. Dries much more gently as well. I can't believe AEG don't make more of a song and dance about the ""Steam"" function - this is excellent and creases just drop out.

"The inside of this fridge is very well designed with lots of space, freezer drawers are great, deep and hold lots of food. Only a couple of issues which to my mind are very important, 1) doors do not seem to close tight, quite often find that the door(s) are open slightly creating a soggy mess in the fridge and a iced up freezer. I sometimes find the fridge is very noisy depending what is in door cavity! Makes a very loud buzzing noise!",Approved
"Looking for a built-in coffee machine?

"A good simple design which suits us but badly let down by the installation drawings which are totally and obviously wrong. I emailed customer services who just sent me another totally wrong drawing. I then gave a detailed explanation including a revised sketch showing the obvious error but have not had a response from customer services. So zero marks for AEG customer service. 
We are also a bit puzzled by the way that it continues to run after the cooking time has ended but there is nothing in the instruction book about this. There is no point in emailing customer services about this after my previous experience with them over the drawings.
So have reduced the rating from Good to Average",Rejected
"Quiet, nice and slick. Fitted straight into the space vacated by old integrated microwave. Was also delivered on time.",Approved
"This was purchased to replace an old combination oven as it was faulty and we didn't need all the features. It is one of the few that fits the space, and my only comment is that the microwave section would have been bigger and still fitted, as there is a lot of empty space below and above. However, it is plenty big enough for our needs and works well.",Approved
"Overall I am very pleased with the cooker. The quality of workmanship and materials inspires me with confidence. Angled controls make it easy to see and adjust settings. The step up to the controls from the hob took a little getting used to but I am now used to it and think nothing of it. The one criticism I have is the absence of a grill pan with a handle. When cooking for two a smaller grill pan with a handle would be very useful. Please let me know if you ever make one for it. I am pleased with my purchase, it was a good choice.",Approved
"Fantastic product, a real pleasure to use ! It is incredible that it heats water up so fast.
My only disappointment is that for such an expensive cooker it is not supplied with an electric cable to install and this has to be purchased in addition.",Approved
"It is all you expect from a fridge freezer at a reasonable price. The ability to modify the shelf storage on the door is fun but not that useful.

It comes with a carbon filter for smell but I doubt that I (or most people) would bother changing it.

The freezer part doesn't have a led light which is a shame - even a small one would've been quite useful. 
Also, the freezer compartment can't be regulated separately which would also be nice. 
Lastly, there is no thermometer to show you the exact temperature in the fridge/freezer.

Overall a good, but I would say the small details that it lacks would certainly be of use in order to make it a more useful product.",Approved
"AEG have produced a super stylish, sleek and superior quality fridge with excellent capacity and great internal features. Stainless steel trimmed glass shelving and a bright led light adds a touch of glamour to midnight feasts. Quiet, easy to clean and efficient. The perfect companion to my new matching freezer. I love them.",Approved
"The fridge looks good and all fixtures and fittings are of quality material. However, there seems to have been little though to how the unit actually stores food.
For a start, the insulation inside the unit is thicker - this is a good thing for efficiency but means that there is less space inside than the model that it replaces. This has other knock-on effects - the wine rack only hold 4 bottles, rather than five and, further, this is poorly located vertically, wasting limited inter-shelf space.
We have fiddled around with the shelf positions and there seems to be no way of storing standard yoghurt and cream containers.
All in all disappointing, given the cost.",Approved
Very pleased with this product. Fridge and freezer are so spacious. Plenty of room for everything and so many features. The fridge keeps food fresh for ages. The freezer is far bigger than I thought it would be. Overall it really works for me especially as I used to have a normal fridge and chest freezer. I love my new AEG fridge/ freezer.,Approved
"excellent product, can adjust plates to suit different types of pots.",Approved
"This fridge has lots and lots of space. However there is a major problem with the door. Even after it has been closed for several minutes it takes a very strong tug to open it. If you try to reopen it within a minute or so it is very difficult indeed. It may be that all AEG customers are healthy young fit men but suppose you happen to be an elderly person, without so much capacity for this you will find it very difficult to open. I have only managed to set this correctly by introducing a thin cable that becomes caught to use help to unseal the door. This still gives an entirely satisfactory seal but it does allow it to be opened much more regularly.

The alarm that are supposed to sound when the door is left open for any length of time never seems to go off. Attempts to get a response from support have not yet produced anything.",Approved
It's been three weeks since I've started using my new cooktop and I love it. It's easy to use and to keep clean. Am very happy with our decision to purchase it.,Approved

This is our 1st induction hob having had ceramic hobs previously. We have found the hob amazingly fast to heat food but also easy to control the heat when up to the correct temperature. The controls are easy to use and it's really easy to clean. Just need to wipe.,Approved
This hob is excellent quality. Does everything I need it to do and is a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend.,Approved
"My only complaint is about the ridiculously noisy spin cycle - with only a half-full load. Either a design, manufacture or fitting fault, but it is far noisier than a much older AEG model I use in another property. I cannot understand why you sell such a noisy product.",Approved
Extremely pleased with this induction hob. Easy to use and keep clean. It looks good and is up to expectation. Would thoroughly recommend this product to anyone interested in induction cooking.,Approved
Love this hob. So easy to clean and very powerful. Heats up a pan of water in seconds - there is now an end to the days of pre-boiling water in the kettle. The fitters said it was slightly deeper than other hobs they've fitted so there needed to be some adjustments. Something to check before installing over an oven.,Approved
This is our first induction hob so all a bit strange. Getting to grips with the settings which confuse me a bit. I guess I need more practice but love tha fact that the pan handles don't get hot now so much easier to keep out of the way of children,Approved

"Good quality , plenty of room , and frost free! Easy to install . Would certainly recommend .",Approved
This fridge replaced a 30 yr. old Zanussi which was working well but the kitchen was getting a revamp so the AEG was chosen. I have had the utmost difficulty getting this fridge to attain sufficiently low temperature. As with all fridges the top is not as cold as the bottom but with this model the temperature range is much too great. The temperature of the top section is much too high. When I open it in the morning when the door has been closed quite a few hours is is frequently 7.5 degrees C. The temperature control knob is at 5.5 but is still not cooling food sufficiently at the top but is freezing food at the bottom when I don't want it frozen. It does not seem to matter if the apparatus is full or half full or nearly empty.. Since this model was one of the most expensive on display I am very disappointed with its performance. I have used 3 different thermometers so it is not an issue with the accuracy of the readings.,Approved
I recently bought a one. It is very nicely functioning. For the price worth to buy it.,Approved
"Emergency purchase to replace a broken similarly-sized fridge (not AEG). Very pleased so far - works efficiently, door shelving storage flexible and well designed. 2 minor quibbles - no bottle rack in main body of fridge. I don't feel the shelving makes the best use of the storage area - would be better with another shelf and/or bottle rack.
Also, I would have preferred 2 small veg/crisper compartments at bottom of fridge, rather than 1 large one. I find the large full width crisper rather heavy and cumbersome to get out, especially when full of heavy items like carrots and potatoes.",Approved
i am very pleased with my new cooker easy to clean and nice looking,Approved
"We are getting used to the taps which are awkward to turn for a right handed person; the lowest temperature coming after the highest.
Also, the grill is only accessible by turn through the oven position.

The grill tray is heavy, does not slide easily in or out, difficult to withdraw. The lack of a handle makes taking the tray out, dangerous when it is hot after grilling. We prefer grilled food, so this is very evident
when we use it. The tray needs to be lighter and narrower to facilitate easier handling.

We would be interested in your comments regarding the above.

Thank you
Mr and Mrs C. Waugh",Rejected
I am so disappointed that I bought this fridge I had to order on line as there was no stock in the shop believing that I had bought a fridge from a good maker I believed they would incorporate into their design all important safety features which would include a metal back on the fridge for fire safety as recommended by fire departments over a considerable time.,Rejected
"Although having the same external dimensions as my old fridge, this AEG seems to have an enormous capacity. The salad drawer is huge without sacrificing much of the other storage space. Loads of bottle/jar storage in the door too. With the LED interior light, it is very white and bright inside and the stainless steel exterior keeps looking good with just the occasional 'once-over' with a damp duster. I would definitely recommend this fridge. I only gave four stars for design, as the door seal can be quite 'sucky' and this fridge would have benefited from a pivoting handle which levers against the door frame to aid opening (as my old fridge did).",Approved
"Both ovens are fan operated giving excellent all over even cooking, nothing burnt or half browned. Both ovens about the same size, no probems with fitting in the xmas dinner this year. Glass door makes it clear to see how contents are doing without having to open the door.",Approved
"This fridge maximises the interior space without compromising on efficiency and insulation. There are 4 hygienic glass shelves with choice of heights available to suit different needs. The crisper in the bottom is transparent and your fruit/veg/salad are clearly visible. There is adequate door storage for milk bottles, jams, pickles, dairy products, chocolate or whatever you fancy. 

The auto defrost function is great and there is fan assisted cooling for rapid temperature recovery after the door has been open. Brilliant idea for food safety. There is a very convenient and easy to see LED temperature panel. Really handy to keep a check on temperature fluctuations if you are in and out of your fridge frequently. 

The outer casing is brushed stainless steel which looks sleek and attractive in any kitchen. The cable length is long enough to easily reach the sockets.

We like it so much that we'd like to buy the matching freezer next. I'd highly recommend it.",Approved
"Huge capacity with well organised shelving which can be arranged in a number of ways. Top quality feel to all the parts including the two sliding drawers one of which does not slide out until YOU want it to, great after my last fridge where this kept happening! Little extras like the stay fresh unit which does not get in the way of storage. Almost silent running, just purrs occasionally, doors that don't slam shut when you have a handful of things, very clear and precise temperature gauge. Mine is in the white and fits and looks really good. Good value for money having compared a lot of fridges of this size.",Approved
"Lovely quality, but I had to read the instructions and I may need to read them again! Moving the pan around can cause the hob to switch itself off, not sure why.
Having said that, it boils water very quickly, and it is easy to clean.
Overall I am very pleased with it",Approved
"I was selected by the manufacturer to receive a free product in return for an honest review. I received the 60cm AEG Induction Hob HK654400FB which replaced my 2 year old Indesit Gas Hob. I’ve never had an Induction hob before, and previous experiences with other electric types such as Ceramic, had always led me to choose gas.

Efficiency – With very little knowledge at the start of how Induction technology works I was under the assumptions my energy bills would now be sky high with the 7.4kw electricity capacity required. After a little re-education thanks to AEG, I learnt that actually Induction is one of the most efficient ways to cook, unlike gas where most of the heat actually escapes, Induction only heats the pan, no matter what size. Not only that the heat is instant, so no more putting oil in the pan to cook and walking away while waiting for it to heat up, it literally takes seconds. I’ve spent a month closely tracking my energy consumption on my smart meter and been comparing my gas and electricity consumption since changing and have noticed a considerable cost saving – even though I’ve actually been cooking more.

Features – Following on the theme of efficiency there is the neat feature of automatic heat up, which you can set it to heat to the highest number and then automatically reduce to what you need. Ideal when you want to bring things to the boil then automatically set to simmer, I’ve found it great for heating soups and making sauces. Using the feature is a bit fiddly and I have had to revert to the instructions on several occasions but once you get the hang of it, it’s incredibly useful. For general usage you will just use the touch slider for setting the temperature, after a few days of cooking you will get used to what the numbers mean and what you prefer to cook at. They heat settings are also unbelievably responsive, with gas I would quickly take a pan off the hob if it was about to boil over but with this one slide of the finger and the heat is off. There are also individual hob timers but I’ve not really used them properly yet.",Approved
Great product does what it says nice cool air conditioning & very quiet would highly recommend it,Approved
"We purchased this model as a replacement for its 12 year old predecessor, which had recently begun to ice up o the back of the interior. Sadly this beautifully designed new model is alternating between icing up on the back wall, and flowing excessively with water. Having spoken to our supplier and tried a higher running temperature, we will be calling in the service engineer in the new year. Hope for a speedy resolution. We were very disappointed by the truly appalling standard of English in the instruction manual.",Approved
"This is the worst cooker I have ever experianced. The grill is little more than useless, The top oven needs to be on a high number to be effective .

"This product was purchased to install on a narrowboat. As such it had to be no more than 50cms wide (to get through the doors). It also had to be as energy efficient as possible and it had to use as little water as possible. It fits all these criteria.

My only complaint is that if the spin speed is set to maximum (1300RPM) then it bounces all over the place! However a spin speed of 900RPM does the job with no machine movement.

"Our previous lader fridge was an integrated design. This really compromised the internal shelf width because it was inside a 60cm cabinet and the fridge cabinet and thick walls of insulation took up alot of space. The result was you could get little more than 1 dinner plate on each shelf..
It proved quite difficult finding a freestanding, tall lader fridge to effectively put into the same space in our kitchen. We even looked at commercial fridge designs.
The AEG got out vote after we had seen one because even though it has a very high energy rating, the insulation is quite compact. We knew from the data sheet it was almost 25% larger inside than our old integrated, but nowhere does it tell you the shelf width, which is a good indication iof the usability of that space. The AEG is a much wider shelf!!
Another plus is the number of 4 pint milk containers you can put in the door... 
We bought an extra shelf which easily fits (I think it should be sold with an extra shelf to make the most of the design). Dont bother with an extra shelf for the door... although there is an unused fitting, it is too close and you cannot get jam jars etc into it! 
Finally with the stainless steel finish it looks good in the kitchen ...so pleased we moved on from integrated.",Approved
Overall the oven cooks very well and much quicker than my last gas oven. I am disappointed with the steam clean function which does not seem to work at all so would mot recommend the oven if buying for that feature.,Approved
The design of the fridge is good and if it lasts as well as the last one it will be good but the quality of the build is not of the same quality as the first one. Bottom drawer used to be on runners which made it easy to use but on the new model it is basically a bin and not as easy to pull out. The wine rack is more flimsy and one less shelf.,Approved
"Food is kept at a standard temperature throughout the fridge and the fridge operation is very quiet. Design is generally spascious and pratical, however the top door butter storage is difficult to access for short persons and would be better if it was possible to mount it in a lower position.

Lighting is excellent and so far there is no sign of over condensation causing water to run out of the evaporation tray onto the floor as with our previous larder fridge.",Approved
"Once I got used to the halogen feature after being used to the old electric rings, I find the cooker excellent value for money and easy to use and keep clean. First time I have purchased a Zanussi product and very pleased with it so far.",Approved
"Two bottom drawers are perfect for fruit/veg and meat. Lots of space in the door for sauces, milk etc.

Food seems to keep fresher for longer than with my old fridge. No condensation.

So spacious, you can open the door and see at a glance what you want.

Looks great and the five year guarantee gives peace of mind.",Approved
"Unfortunately opening the fridge is problematic. The settings for the door opening are too firm which means I have to yank the door open each time with too much force. The weakest setting means the door does not shut properly. There is no happy medium.
This is a shame as the rest of the fridge is perfect.",Approved
Had electric ovens all my life but this one I dislike. When putting a hob ring on it will constantly go on and off because of the temp control. No good when waiting for it to boil. Tried to grill crumpets and toast but takes forever as same thing happens,Approved

"Good fridge, lots of storage but the one issue we have with it is the stiffness of the door - great that the magnetic catch keeps the contents cold but it's a big wrench to open especially if one has just opened the door and then closed it to try to open it again bows the handle ! The temperature on the front is useful but would be more useful if it showed the actual temperature inside the fridge rather than what it has been set to.",Approved
Easy to install and use with excellent features and great temperature control,Approved
The sleek design and ample storage space make this fridge a huge asset.,Approved
"I am so disappointed in this product. My original AEG which had served us reliably for 11 years developed an issue on 22nd December 2016 so I made the decision to replace it like for like with this model in time for Christmas Day. AO.com duly obliged with delivery the following day. Today is Christmas Day and the inside of the fridge is effectively at room temperature whilst the freezer is barely maintaining the frozen status of its contents. The warranty registration line is available 24hrs, 365 days a year but the repair one is closed; what's the point of that? What a complete waste of time!!",Rejected
"The fridge constantly freezes over even if the fridge is partially full, it was also delivered with the doors misaligned and after AEG came to realign they weren't able to and we've had to live with misaligned doors since..

Customer support on this site has been non-existent. Questions and emails have been unanswered. In the end we had to pay for someone to come out and take a look.

The AEG technicians that came out weren't much help, one told us not to put items in certain areas of the fridge against the walls as it will affect the sensors in the walls of the fridge (no mention of this in the manuals), One even told us to scrap it and tried to get us to buy a new one immediately. 

In our opinion we shouldn't have to worry about sensors in the fridge especially when the fridge is not packed in tight and we are ensuring it is shut tight. I don’t know of anyone else with different fridges having to worry about this, Simply open the door, place items in, close door and move on, With this item it is a constant worry if food will be spoilt because the fridge has frozen over through normal usage. Each time it happens we have to empty both sides, and switch off for 24 hours. 

Save yourself a lot of hassle and do not buy this item and don't even bother with non-existent customer support.",Approved
"Very happy with the new washer. Faster spin than the old one, takes a bigger load than the old one. Excellent price as well. Also being able to set it to come on in 3,6, or 9 hours later is a new thing for us and a great idea, you can set it so it is finished when you walk in the door after work or its finished when you get up in the morning. Would highly recommend to anyone.",Approved
The machine washes ok but I miss a timer or at least some indication of where the washing cycle is. This machine seems to go from wash and then to end.,Approved
"This is a great fridge freezer with just one small flaw. It was a perfect replacement for our previous 60/40 fridge freezer, fitting perfectly into the space occupied by our previous model. Installation was straight forward and all the parts provided had been well designed to make things easy. The internal layout allows for multiple storage configurations. The one thing we don't like is the LED fridge light which doesn't illuminate straight away, taking a couple of seconds to gradually increase in brightness. This delay means that when you open the door you are confronted with total darkness and have to wait for the light to come on before you can select the item you want, unless you can remember where it is. This is a flaw in the design and it is rather irritating when the rest of the product is so well designed.",Approved
"I am happy with the appliance overall. I love the frost free feature and the digital thermostat. The design is nice too. However, there is one thing that I dislike very much - the freezer drawers were made of plastic that just look cheap and very fragile. There is no doubt they will break under the weight of the frozen food at some point. This was a huge disappointment compared to my freezer that it replaced - Smeg, which had very sturdy metal wire drawers.",Approved
"Don’t have to think how long to put tumbledryer on for as it thinks for itself. Best tumbledryer I have had, and I have had a few over 54 years of married life. Towels are lovely and fluffy. Drum is large, no complains with this item. I have also had an AEG washing machine.",Approved

"I have been asked to write a review on this unit, to start with it was not my first choice as this is the third in less than ten years, I wanted a further upmarket brand to try to get longevity but through matters beyond my control had to revert back to AEG.
On arrival after it was fitted by the supplier I was told to leave it for at least 6 hours to settle, this I did, then I switched it on, inserted my remote temp sensors for fridge and freezer and left it to its own devices, after 48 hrs it had not got down below -11c.
the reason for the sensors is that after the last two failing after the five year warranty run out I keep a good watch on them.
anyway by a fluke of luck I decided to take all the tapes off all the freezer bins and found that the top bin made contact with the circulating fan, after investigation I eventually found out that there was a missing panel at the back which protects the the fan and electrics. after pulling the bin away from the fan , it eventually got down to -18c or lower and a week later under warranty the panel was replaced, (no problem encountered organizing this).

specifically good thing about this product is that it is one of the few integrated units to have two salad drawers a must have with built in units. 

dubious thing is that at least with this unit there is a fluctuation in temp for the freezer between -13c and -27c approx to a setting of -18c

uncertain thing is will it last beyond 5 years, I have my doubts on past experience but live in hope its funny that when buying extended warranty's they never go past 5 years.

will I buy AEG again, only if this unit lasts significantly past 5 years because if it doesn't I will rip out the built in cabinet and buy a floor standing one and again try to go further up market.

there is only yes or no on recommendation, I say yes because on the face of it its a nice unit, but would I recommend it for longevity only if you pay the extended warranty and hope it gets past 5 Years.",Approved
"Eventually decided on this particular Fridge/Freezer mainly due to good reviews & wanting to purchase a reliable & good quality product that’s built to last. As stated, it’s still early days but no issues or concerns so far. Only 2 negatives, firstly (not a major issue & as stated in some other reviews I believe) the design/positioning of the salad drawers is not ideal as you can’t remove each one individually, to remove the one which is on the same side the door opens to, you have to remove the other one first. Secondly, which is dissapointing for me is the fact that I purchased an AEG believing it to be German & built in Germany, sadly (after purchasing it) I discovered it was actually made in a Country where I wouldn’t normally choose to purchase appliances from. Given it wasn’t cheap either, only time will tell if my my faith (& money spent) is rewarded & it lasts & performs as long & as well as I would hope (& expect) of a German built kitchen appliance.",Approved

"Although a single compressor, it does benefit from separate (and more precise) freezer and fridge temperature controls, and is actually very competitively priced when compared to its peers.

But it works well, has soft auto close doors (and door alarm) , effective LED soft start lighting and reasonably quiet operation with a touch sensitive display panel (= easy clean) with additional functions, such as pre-load conditioning with coolmatic and frostmatic, holiday mode for the fridge etc. 

One significant issue is that despite reference to installation instructions in the handbook, they are not provided and moreover are not available from AEG either! So changing door opening and correctly installing becomes unnecessarily arduous and time consuming trying to work out where all of the pieces from the installation kit go. It's also worth pointing out that the screws provided do not have a standard head, so a special bit is required in order utilise.

Like all fridge freezers, it would still benefit from more shelf position options in both the fridge and the fridge door!

But overall a great frost-free fridge freezer",Approved

"This is a top quality product, which is what you would expect from AEG.

"Please do not be drawn in by the pictures, Looks great but the capacity is not enough for a family of 4 and the plastic parts within the fridge are flimsy and cheap. The salad drawers at the bottom do not easily come in and out, but the worse thing is the dairy compartment has broken within 2 months of purchase. The lips on the drawer are too short for the wheel mechanism and can not hold any weight that you would expect with cheese and butter. The lip has completely broken off and the drawer is now useless. Only 2 months old but I have been told plastic components are not covered by any warranty and I must purchase another drawer myself. Surely this fridge freezer is not fit for purpose if it can not hold the goods the parts claim to be for! 
Do not buy - you will be as disappointed as I am.",Approved
"The fridge is fine but the freezer, which is supposed to be frost free, has a problem due to ice building up on the bottom of the compartment. I have had two visits so far under the guarantee to remove it. There is a drain hole under the cooling element that is supposed to let condensation flow out but it freezes solid and I cannot see how this is supposed to stay ice free without a full defrost. It looks like the freezer is going to need de-frosting manually at regular intervals. The service engineer could not offer any explanation as to why this was happening.",Approved

"What works well: it cools very effectively and freezes quickly. We've had to turn the temperature to the highest level (8 degrees?) to stop the fridge being too cold.
Interior layout is flexible and convenient.
Interior lighting is good.
Space efficiency is good - maximum internal volume within the dimensions.

Even better if: the compressor was quiet. This replaced an Electrolux which only lasted 8 years (poor) but is significantly noisier.
Freezer drawers were more solid - they feel flimsy.

I wouldn't reccommend because of the almost constant low level hum - it's pretty annoying.",Approved

Second disappointment is that I have lowered the temperature to 2 degrees now and still when I take food from the fridge, it is frozen, i.e. broccoli, mushrooms, tomatoes.

"I bought this drier to replace my old one that had become quite noisy.

I was drawn to the nice features and build quality but mainly to the claim that it is ""A quieter, almost silent way to dry your clothes""

Whilst the machine functions well in every other respect, it is far from quiet. It is as noisy, if not noisier than my old drier.

I assumed the machine was faulty so arranged a service visit with AEG who in fairness were helpful and receptive. But when the engineer visited, he said that the level of noise was normal for this machine.

I initially imagined that the machine was faulty so called AEG who to their credit were very responsive. They sent an engineer who looked at the machine and told me that the noise it was producing was normal.

"This cooker is easy to use and easy to clean. The wide main oven which accommodates 3 racks is useful when cooking a roast for 4+ people. The grill pan is great to be able to cook 6 slices of toast at the same time ...... However, it is not very easy to handle partly due to there not being a handle to the pan, which makes it awkward during cooking. The light on the top oven is a bonus when using it as an oven. Overall I am pleased with this cooker but a different idea with the grill pan would make it an excellent product.",Approved
"Very pleased with this hob, it has really good features and it is really easy to keep clean. I was very hesitant to switch from Gas but I found that it performs well against Gas and even though it is electric the temperature control reacts quickly when you turn it up or down. Although mine is fairly new, there is a few light scratches which is a little concerning, but overall brilliant.",Approved
The top oven is surprisingly spacious - probably due to the design of having the controls higher than normal - a good safety feature too as young children cannot reach and twiddle with the controls. Virtually no heat emanates from either of the two ovens whilst they are cooking - another safety feature for small hands touching the outsides of the oven...The hob has a 'hot hob' warning light which is useful. The electric hobs are very controllable - almost as good as gas! I would recommend cleaning any marks off the hob after use - particularly before the next time - clean it with a damp cloth and it polishes up very well with a dry tea towel. The entire oven is very impressive and the price is favourable. Don't waste money on higher priced alternatives!,Approved
I purchased this Zanussi tumble dryer in the wake of other manufacturers failing to provide a reliable product and previously a Hotpoint owner I was soon to move to a brand I could trust so if your thinking about a product that does the job don't think just buy!,Approved
"Solid machine, great features without having un-necessary over digitalised menus. I’ve found it so much more effective than my previous machine. Clothes come out dry to the level you specify. Perfect every time. Really happy with my purchase",Approved
"We bought this cooker approx. 4 months ago as we were limited to width size, plus the previous review gave it a good rating.
Unfortunately, I have found that the gas control is difficult to manage, especially the grill. It seems to be either on or off - no inbetween, If you try to turn it down the gas goes out. The same with the hob. The small gas 
fitting on the hob is quite useless. The gas control of the oven is way out and when using a recipes guide of using a 6 - it almost burns.
Very, very disappointed with this appliance, as we thought Zanussi were a good reliable brand.",Approved
"We're quite a large family so the 9kg drum size really helps. With any load size, the water softener feature is noticeable with clothes much softer compared to previously. The 3kg 20 minute program is also useful for things needed in a hurry. The allergy wash for bedding is great too. Usually we fill the entire drum and wash in eco mode (where compatible) and the cleaning is extremely impressive. It's also very quite with no need to close the doors in order to talk. The 5 year guarantee is reassuring too.",Approved
"Just a easy machine to use, great settings very versatile, easy to install, large capacity & even us blokes can use it",Approved
So far so good. Purchased the dryer from John Lewis on price match at a great price and so far it seems to perform much better than our previous machine (made by a well-known German brand beginning with B!) and cost considerably less!,Rejected
"At last a machine that can dry a duvet cover without tangling it into a wet ball - unlike another very expensive German made machine I had before this. The programs are straightforward, simple to select and yes, they work. The only negative is the buzzer indicating the end of a cycle is much too quiet but I wouldn't mark it down for that. I love this machine and I wish I'd given up on my last one a lot sooner.",Approved
After first charge last d 15 min and would not charge again- returned,Approved
Delighted to find the machine is very quick to dry clothes and leaves them in a reasonably 'wrinkle free' state (many do not need ironing). There are a good range of settings and it is easy to use.,Approved
The product is great and full of super features and comes with a Free two year guarntee,Approved
"Excellent tumble drier. Efficient, robust and reliable and above al dry's very quickly with excellent setting options covering all one's needs. Highly recommended.",Approved
"This is out first wash dryer. So, we cannot compare it to others, but we indeed like it.",Approved
Typical German look and performance make this an ideal choice in any kitchen,Approved
"I haven't quite got the knack of this yet as I have only had it a few weeks and with the nice weather have dried most things outside. There are lots of different combinations of heat settings to get used to, with iron dry, cupboard dry etc. I have always been careful with what I have put in the dryer incase they shrink. My last tumble dryer was pretty basic as it only had the 2 settings, high and low heat and I had to judge the length of drying time, but it lasted me for 25 years so can't complain. This however has different settings for different fabrics so it is ideal and takes the initiative for the temperature and drying time, so it's great and I recommend it.",Approved
"I have no complaints about the machine. It dries very quickly and there are so many options..maybe too many. My only gripe is the vent hose...within 2 days it had split and was unusable. AEG were excellent and sent another within 4 days. Now I think maybe this is usual for vent hoses. To be flexible they have to be thin but a lot of weight causes the splits. I have attached a support with cable ties to spread the weight along a length, not pretty but better than constant replacement. Overall for the price unbeatable",Approved
love this cooker. love everything about it great price,Approved
"After reading various reviews of this machine I was fully expecting an efficient machine however what I got was a machine that starting squeaking after the first couple of seconds which then turned into a loud screech and wasn’t drying the washing very well. Had to phone up to get an engineer out which I have to admit I received excellent service, the engineer arrived the day after we made the phone call and it turned out one of the sensors was hitting the drum, it’s now fixed, I hope",Approved
"This is a lovely oven with good features, including the option of fan cooking if I want it.",Approved
"A great cooker, well designed, loads of room and three shelves with it. Big grill pan. Bit steamy sometimes but you get used to it! Instant heat with the hob. All in all an excellent cooker and great value for money.",Approved
"I like the different function options for the main oven and also if you are only cooking a small dinner or for one person the top oven can be used saving on electricity.

The cooker is very easy to clean on the hob.

The only feature that I dislike is the noise when you move the oven racks as it makes a grating noise on the coating of the oven.

I also like the timer feature of the oven and the clock function and the knobs are in a good position for people who are visually impaired and easy to turn for someone with poor dexterity in the wrists and you don't have to bend down to check dials.",Approved
"Love how you can set the hob to full power and when it reaches a desired setting it automatically reduces power to that setting.
Also like stop and go feature and overall look and quality.",Approved
"At first the machine looks intimidating but within mins of reading the manual you will find it east and quick to navigate around the control panel.
The controls are clear and easy to read and the water is collected in an easy pull out drawer, which can be easily emptied. You can opt for a plumbed in kit to empty into a drain.
Heavy construction compared with other makes. This is a rubust machine which looks as if it will last.
It is my third load and what makes it so interesting, is that you set your programme choice and the machine constantly measures the dryness of the clothes and will switch off automatically, early, to save electricity and to stop wear on the garments.
It really could not be easier. Very quiet in operation and the fluff filter is easy to get to.
Hey, I'm a Bloke and I can drive this thing, so anyone can!",Approved
"I was used to an on/off dryer so had to study the manual a bit. Once onboard with the controls, best dryer I have ever had. Easy to empty water container, large door, easy to clean filter. I like this dryer very much. Good purchase.",Approved
"The reason we purchase this model is it was a good make and energy efficient. 
But it has surpassed our expectations and ver quiet to boot.",Approved
Food heats up quickly but it would be nice if the surface was a little easier to keep shiny,Approved
"This is our first condenser drier and we've experienced a few weeks use. On the positive side it's quiet, easy to use and in the current cold weather the recycled heat is doing us more good than venting it outside. Overall we're very pleased with it.
My criticisms are that the vent drain kit was difficult to identify and I had to make phone contact to confirm its suitability. Easily installed but required an extra standpipe. Personally I couldn't be bothered with having to empty the condensate drawer after every use, along with the dust filter. In addition, the drier wouldn't have fitted otherwise as there is insufficient access to withdraw the container fully.
Secondly, the drier seems very sensitive to the content materials. So we find that mixed materials are not all dried evenly. This requires additional airing or drying for some articles.",Approved
This dryer does not dry clothes well.It stops before completing its cycle forcing you to start it again to get your garments anywhere near dry!!!!not impressed with this product...,Approved
This is our first induction hob and boy are we impressed. This appliance is good looking and packed with features. The controls are very intuitive and is fantastically responsive. Added to AEG's first class build quality we know we are going to have years of reliable service.,Approved
".....which is filter design. Bought this to replace previous AEG Tumble Dryer which we had been very happy with. My only 'niggle' is the filter placement & design; on previous model the filter was attached to the door which made cleaning very easy. On this model the filter is smaller & built into door frame, easy to remove but a fiddle to clean, as particles get stuck in the corners.....the larger screen type filter was better. Apart from this, very happy with the tumble dryer.",Approved
"This was a replacement for another brand which had developed a fault after 5 years. It's quiet, but not very user-friendly to operate - there are a lot of options available, but none of the programmed 'Sensor' modes dried properly so ended up using the timed modes only. So we may as well have got a less expensive model as the Sensor modes are a waste of time! I don't know if it's because the unit is faulty, or if it's the design - I suspect it's the design. So I have been very disappointed in AEG as a brand, and would not recommend.",Approved
"Great looking extractor, looks brilliant in our kitchen with all other AEG appliances.  Quiet but powerful, would definitely recommend!",Approved
"First induction hob, love it. Does everything it says on the box and is easy to master.

Little tip I got from John Lewis, Newcastle (thank you) - I asked about stains and cleaning them when they happen - was told to prevent them by putting a tea towel under any pan that may spill or splash. Seems to go totally against the rules but it works, try it.",Approved
One improvement is to make the cable longer than 2m.,Approved
"This oven looks great in my kitchen, the features and programmes are great. Although I like the steam function, the white film left over after using steam can be difficult to clean.",Rejected
"Induction Hob, easy to use....cleans very well, we should have bought one years ago....still finding our way around but the instructions are easy to understand even for me at my age......should we have received a FREE product?",Approved
"This was a replacement, for another make that the supplier could not get parts for( less than a year old) i chose this hob as it has powerful rings, with boosts and an option for salmon poacher etc. It has timer, child lock and has front touch controls, rather than knobs or side controls.And it looks good,and it is easy to keep clean.Brilliant purchase so far!",Approved
"Very easy to use compared with some other induction hobs and well laid out.
The manual could be more explanatory.",Approved
Features and functions are excellent. The difference between this and our old gas hob are unbelievable.,Approved

"We was given this product for free of charge by AEG in return for an honest review.

We are blown away by how fantastic this product has been for us so far. We have used this for all sorts of clothes on all different settings, and everything has come out alot better results than we was expecting.

The water tank is easy to empty being based in the top left hand corner. The control panel is easy to use, and easy to navigate through the programmes to the one you want and using the additional options to either reduce the time or select any anti-creasing options etc.

What one of the great things with this product is that it detects the dampness of the items in the drum and adjusts the time accordingly so your items don't get over dried, and also saves on your energy running costs.

The clothes have been looked after really well by the machine, and I am mighty impressed with all the options available to me in terms of drying specific types of clothes at different types of drying levels. This is by far the best Tumble Dryer I have ever had the privilege of using!",Approved
"I decided to invest in a new dryer to match my new AEG washer, and decided I wanted something much more energy efficient,so I made the decision to go with a heat pump dryer. What a fabulous product. I can dry the most delicate of items in this machine safe in the knowledge that no harm will ensue.

Yes, it might take two and a half hours to dry a load of cottons, but as they are dried much more gently and using a lower temperature than many dryers, it's worth the wait. Articles are soft and fluffy, and never over-dried.

I get much less creasing with this dryer compared to previous dryers, even with a full load of cotton items from the matching 8kg washer.

Wear and tear on the items is reduced, and this is evidenced through the filter in the dryer. The lint accumulation from a dryer load is less than half it was on dryers I have owned in the past.

Definitely one to buy!",Approved
This dryer is fantastic it isn't noisy like most models drys really well and bedding doesn't roll up into a ball as it's got 3 long large paddles in it which in my eyes is better then 2 small ones like most dryers drys quick it's very easy to use the newness smell takes a while to go but that isn't a problem loads of settings suit anyone's needs tank easy to empty and so is the filter and condenser good quality nothing flimsy really made up with it,Approved
Has a good quality feel about it when using the control panel or opening and cloaing the door. Clothes dry well.,Approved
"We have all ways had Zanuusi products with very little problems so we decided to update our tumbler dryer from an Hotpoint tumbler dryer to an Zanuusi Condencer Dryer.
The Digital display took a bit getting use too, then it stopped drying cloths,
so we thought it might something we were doing wrong seeing that the dryer was only 3 months old.
So the engineers were called they changed the sensor still not working they then returned and changed the Element & the Circuit board.
For something that is only 3 months old and haven't been used a lot in the summer there would seam a lot of problems, so are we happy with our purchase not sure",Approved
"I never realised how much better an induction job could be. The large size of perfect for larger pans, it also can boil a pan of water faster than the kettle. Excellent safety features and the reaction to controls in instantaneous preventing burning or boiling over. The job also shuts down if water is spilled to prevent pan boiling over. 
I would 100% buy again!",Approved
Compared to our last machine the AEG is much quieter.,Approved
"If you write review text, it should be at least 50 characters, otherwise only your ratings will count.",Approved
"I am so pleased with this drier. It is quick, apparently uses less energy than other similar products and dries the clothes well. My main reason for wanting to try this drier was the fact that it has a specific programme for bed linen. My last AEG drier always wound my duvet cover up into a ball which had to be sorted out several times during the drying process. This often resulted in creases. I am delighted to report that this is not the case with the new drier; no creases, no ball, no ironing. Wonderful! I have also used a couple of other programmes. The cotton programme is great for shirts and t shirts. I have only used the ' mixed' programme once. A few things were a bit damp after the cycle had finished but , I think, more from my choice of load than the drier's fault. I am very pleased with my new tumble drier.",Approved
"Great hob, very responsive and easy to use. Only slight downfall is how hot it can be when the pan is removed, dissipates fairly quickly though.",Approved
Nice looking does a good job and compliments our AEG combined microwave/oven hob and steam oven.,Approved
"As expected, the product in itself is excellent. The one issue we have concerns how everything sits once stacked up in a tower with a double-oven. It took our fitter a long time to make it all fit in, cutting the wooden framework very carefully, but ending up with a compromise on how low the plate warmer is and how high the top oven ends up being (slightly too high in our opinion).",Approved
"We had the microwave-combi oven fitted with our new kitchen 2 and a half years ago. It stopped working and cost me just under £200 to repair it. AEG/Electrolux didn’t want to know, so I had to call out a repairman who said it was a fault in the magnetron. You don’t pay over £600 for an oven to last only 2 and a half years. Rather poor quality in my books and I won’t be buying AEG/Electrolux products again.",Approved
does the job required a little on the noisy side though,Approved
"This dryer is good. I have had a previous AEG dryer for nearly 16 years and although the new one has more features, it is as easy and intuitive to use as my last one with exceptional drying results. It has a larger drying capacity and more programmes which can seem a bit overwhelming to begin with - but soon fits in with the wash pattern. However! it is advertised on the AEG site on on many of the retailers sites as having a 'Glass Porthole Door', where (long story) I have now had 2 of these models to try and attain this 'expectation' but have failed on both accounts. For it seems that on the later models supporting the 916 097 094 (02) product no' that you get a plastic see-through porthole door (inside and out) instead of the glass porthole as described. I have had this out with AEG, where their technicians have sworn to me blind that the door should be glass.... and then after investigation... they fall silent! - So my answer to them is....don't advertise a 'glass porthole door' and fail the Trade Description Act! I will keep this 2nd dryer as it is a good performer and dries loads without the guessing games which can come along with some of the other makes and models out there... However! - I shall always be slightly peeved about AEG's failure to accurately describe their product... And I will wait and see how the 'plastic inner and outer porthole' fares after a few years of use.",Approved
the tumble dryer has a really big drum good features plus you can put it in any room of the house without having pipe out the window very happy,Approved
"I had this extractor fan fitted when having new kitchen done; I used it probably 4-5 times and now it won't work after less than a year of having it. The touch pad to turn it on doesn't work but then it comes on at random by itself and I have to switch all electrics off to turn it off. Not impressed. 
I bought all AEG appliances for my new kitchen and regretting it now, so far I had nothing but problems with them, very disappointing.",Approved
"This was a replacement for our original AEG dryer, and although ostensibly a similar specification, this dryer has proven to be even more efficient and effective at drying our laundry. Living in Scotland and with a big family, the dryer is in daily use. The controls are simple and intuitive, and offer a good range of settings to cope with all types of laundry. The drum is big and the door offers good access. Above all though the unit dries fantastically well, probably better than our previous unit which we were very happy with, and does so in a shorter time too. Although we haven't had it long enough to gauge efficiency compared to our previous dryer, and although it is the same A+ rating as the old model, the fact it manages to dry the laundry quicker would bode well for power consumption. All in all very happy, a quality unit that gets 10/10 from us.",Approved
I just used 3-4 times after I bought. So I cannot make more comments,Approved
"Fantastic replacement for a previous tumble dryer. It looks great in the utility room and the large door makes loading and unloading very easy. This dryer runs cooler and quieter than previous dryers I have owned and does not make the room as hot/humid. The improved energy efficiency is a huge bonus as it is in constant use in this house! The controls are clear and simple, the lint collector is very effective and very easy to clean. 
I am very impressed with this product and how it looks!",Approved

Machine very noisy when on spin much noisier than machines I have had in the past, at times thought was going to take off. AEG appliances have not lived up to my expectations very disappointing and unfortunately all kitchen appliances are AEG had to have dishwasher replaced after 4 months!",Approved
"I chose this drier based on the Which magazine recommendation and price and it has proved itself a great performer.
Simple to use, large capacity and a quick drier.
Convenient water condenser tray removal and emptying, easy to clean filters, and a crease prevention periodic tumble after the drying has finished.
Excellent machine and excellent price.",Approved
"Had this dishwasher installed as an extra in our new build house, Very poor design. Glasses do not stand up properly on the racks etc. Doesn't clean properly sometimes. It drives us mad!

What were they thinking when they built this machine? Had a Bosch before and that had nice little touches and was of better quality. In all honesty even though it is now only six months old we are considering replacing it with a Bosch or another make of built in dishwasher.

Personally I would avoid this dishwasher, its a waste of money. There are plenty of other better makes and models about.",Approved
This drier is very quiet and has lots of different settings to use. The only things that I am disappointed with are the buzzer which is not loud enough to hear if you are in another room and the door is very hard to push to open.,Approved
A feature packed tumble dryer with a really efficient set of programmes. Easy to use and very big drum. Highly recommended!,Approved
"I like the energy efficiency of my new machine and combined with the delayed start means I can set it to run when the cheaper evening tariff kicks in. The design is stylish. I’m really impressed how it can dry really big loads efficiently and quickly. I have not owned a tumble drier before and but I specially chose this machine as it is quiet, can take big loads and does not give off much heat. I’m really pleased with my purchase and this model is thoroughly recommended by me. This is a well-built quality product,",Approved
"This is a lovely looking appliance with a very large load. Great for family use. The cycles are gentle on fabrics however when drying bedding can get tangled. Very simple to use with amazingly sensitive buttons,much better than its predecessor. Lovely and quiet. My only negative would be when drying towels they don't get quite dry enough on a program so I use timed drying.",Approved

"This dishwasher is so quiet that I have to check I actually switched it on sometimes. The cutlery basket takes up a lot of room - I'd prefer to be able to move it to the edge but that's personal preference. It cleans well - I mostly use the ECO option. As long as you don't squash things in too tightly, everything gets clean. I love the count down timer - this was one of my essential features. I haven't used the quick wash much - it isn't as good as a full wash but useful for lightly soiled stuff.",Approved

"If you’re looking for an energy saving dryer that is easy to set up and maintain, the AEG 7000 series T7DBG832R Heat Pump Tumble Dryer is a great pick. It has an A+ energy rating with heat pump technology that recycles the hot air making it both environmentally friendly and cost effective to run. The 8kg drum capacity makes it a good size for an average family. As I mentioned before, the dryer is very easy to set up. You just need a place to plug the dryer into a socket. I was a bit nervous to plug it in at first as I felt like I had to be missing something, but it really is just that simple. You don’t need ventilation or drainage pipes, as the condensate container collects the extra water. You do have to drain the condensate container manually by carrying the container to the sink, emptying it and clicking it back into place in the dryer but compared to drilling vent holes in the wall or hanging pipes out of the windows it really is no bother. Cleaning the dyer is easy thanks to the ÖKOFlow Filter System which quick and easy to remove, clean and replace. This does need to be done with each load. 

The machine has lots of drying programs which you adjusting the finished dryness of depending on what your preference is for example selecting iron dry will leave the clothes slightly moist to allow for easier iron, this is particularly handy for shirts when ironing. The dryer also utilises AEG's ""Prosense"" technology which is constantly monitoring the load and adjusts the drying time accordingly. 
The large LED display is very easy to read and displays program section along with the remaining run time for the selected program which is very handy and saves opening the machine to get an idea of how long the load has left to dry. 
We had the predecessor to this machine which we thought was excellent but AEG have made some great improvements with this model, it is quieter more efficient, easier to use and dries a lot better. Clothes seem to come out a lot softer post drying than before. 
Overall it is a fantastic machine I would recommend to anyone.",Approved

"Very bad experience, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE !!!
it came installed by the developer in our new house, started getting short circuited right from the first week resulting shutting off the main circuit breakers and putting half of the house in dark until we managed to learn how to avoid this. it's been more than 8 months and 6 visits by Zanussi incompetent engineers , 3 times changed the impulse generator with poor work quality. Wife extremely annoyed :(
still in dispute with developer and Zanussi to replace it with proper brand and something fit for purpose.
DO NOT BUY THIS !!!",Rejected
i was very disappointed the problems started withe the rubber catching my clothes and marking them with a rubber stain which will not come of the program is like a video game you have to catch it if you can and then i realised every time i turned on the cold tap it was filling up my washer with water,Approved
"when purchasing I was a little hesitant at first with all the different programmes/functions etc., but on receiving washer and reading instructions which were extremely helpful I have used every function and find the washer easy to use I would recommend this machine to anyone thinking of purchasing a new one. Brilliant!!!",Approved
"I've had this dryer now for a few weeks and so far I'm very impressed. 

The dryer is so simple to use and set up was minimal. The dryer is simply plugged in and away you go. The dial gives lots of options as to what it is you want to dry and adjusts the drying time and temperature accordingly. While some of the settings take a little longer than my old dryer, my smart meter doesn't go through the roof when I turn it on as my old machine caused it to do and my clothes don't come out burning hot if I stop it mid cycle. I feel confident that I can put items in this dryer which I wouldn't have put in my old one such as t-shirts with prints and expensive bedding as it doesn't make the clothes too hot and therefore ruin the quality as other machines I have had in the past have done. 

The dryer is also really quiet. I can put this on when the kids are in bed safe in the knowledge that they won't be woken by it. 

Lastly, it looks cool! Really stylish and quite 'space age'. Visitors have commented on how it looks and is almost a feature in my new kitchen rather than an eyesore as most dryers are. 

All in all I am very happy. The only downside (though not really an issue for me) is that some of the settings take a little longer than my old dryer however if the quality of my clothes are retained with the heat being lower and my electricity bill not going through the roof each time I use it, I'm happy to wait a little longer for my clothes to dry. 

Love it so much I now want the matching washing machine!",Approved
"My last machine was basic and easy to use, but although this one has loads of extra features, it is very easy to use. It has multiple wash modes and then you can change the temps, spin speed and length of time of the wash, you can even adjust the start time.
It's great, not very loud and not very deep, so it fits in very nicely. Love it.",Approved

"Bought this dishwasher to replace my old dishwasher which could not be repaired but it had been well used & lasted us 23 years, don't think my new one will do as well ,not as well made as the old one still time will tell . We don't like the cutlery basket we have saved the basket from our old model DW900 so we can always go back to that . The baskets are lot more difficult to stack & also very flimsy . On the whole the wash cycles are ok . I only use the quick programme for non greasy dishes we always rinse our things before we put them in the dishwasher . Pans & very greasy dishes need the longer cycle . I suppose we will get use to our new dishwasher in time . We purchased the same make as we felt 23 years was a GOOD for our well used old dishwasher . Thank you .",Approved
I am disappointed with the information I was given about the machine about the wash cycle times as I was led to believe that if I did a 40C wash it would only take 1hr !5mins but it takes over 2 hours.,Approved
"Generally, I am pleased with my purchase but a little disappointed that the small top oven does not have a light within it, so you cannot see how the cooking is progressing without opening the oven door.",Approved
This product works efficiently and quietly. The touchscreen is easy to use and drying settings are clear. Items dried in the machine come out feeling soft and the fabric is not overworked. The overall rating would have been five stars if it was possible to have a cupboard dry + setting on all drying cycles.,Approved
"We have only been in receipt of the product for a very short time, but so far it appears to be a quality item. It really suits our needs. Well done AEG.",Approved
"Wash's well but all manufactures put to many programs on the machines,keep it simple, the spin dryer doe's not always get the cloth's dry(ringing wet) and have noticed a smell a couple of times from the machine, guess it's the same with all products you get what you pay for",Approved
"I had the tumble dryer for less than two months when it stopped drying clothes and generating any heat. I called John Lewis technical support but was told the dryer is outside the return window, and the item was not dead on arrival so I should call the third party support company to book a repair. The repair was booked with a company called Respond Services, an engineer came out couple days later and ran some diag tests, it was concluded the motherboard was faulty. The part was not in stock so we had to wait another few days before this was replaced. Having spent premium money on a product that should perform equally I was very disappointed. I chose to switch from Bosch to AEG but very much regret it already.",Rejected

"This is the first new washing machine I have bought for 16 years and obviously things have changed. The digital display is full of all the information you need to use the machine. I like the large door making it easier to get stuff in and out of the drum. The extra spin speed compared to my old washer makes a big difference to the finished wash. Much more water is extracted during the spin cycle. To sum it up, it makes a good job of the washing and that's what it's all about.",Approved
"This dryer is very similar in size to my existing AEG Tumble dryer so it fits in perfectly to where we had the old machine. The buttons are much better and easier to operate. The look and feel is a better as well 

The main difference is the heat pump technology used. There is no heat that is pumped out of the dryer making the energy consumption lower. So when passing in front of the we don't feel the hot air blast coming out. This also makes it quieter than my previous tumble dryer. Was worried that the clothes might be dried s much but that has not happened yet

The Prosense technology makes drying times shorter and efficient and it changes the timings in spite of what it says initially for the cycle. It also adjusts the cycle times as well so saves us having to re-do a whole cycle. Lots of different drying options but a bit to figure it first, after that its easy to work through and also allows to change some of the cycles as well 

The position and design of the fluff filter makes it very easy to clean and so is
the water container. The water container is also a bit bigger which is good. We do get the reminders to empty them. It also automatically switch offs when the cycle is completed

Overall impressed by the machine",Approved
"Excellent value machine Has a 30 minute cycle which is time saving Although this only allows the short spin which is fine in summer as the washing is still quite wet
So far the 900 spin is good so the 1600 should be epic
Good washing results and the electronic timer lets you know how long to go till the end",Approved
"I like this Tumble dryer because it is easy to use with just a couple of buttons to press to start it.

I also found it is quieter than my previous model when in use and has quicker drying cycles.

It seems to be quite sturdy and well made.

It is also very easy to empty the excess water and clean the lint from the machine after usage.",Approved

"our double oven we are very pleased with but you can not see the the controls ,you have to be quite tall",Approved
"Only one thing that can improve this great product is the control knobs if your short you to sand on chair 
 Could put extra marinating on panel",Approved
"A nice machine, very efficient. It is worth spending a few minutes familiarising yourself with the instructions as operation is not intuitive. Once read you will find it is very versatile.

My only criticism is that the door is a little too low such that you cannot get a collapsible laundry basket in front of it to empty the contents.",Approved
Have just had a gas oven after years of fan assisted electric ovens I am so glad to now have this AEG. It’s easy to use and cooks beautifully.,Approved
"I've had this machine for a week now and can't begin to tell you how great it is compared my old one. It's so quiet, easy to use and I love the 20 minute quick wash!

The build quality is brilliant, everything feels as if it's been built to last, the door, control knob, even the soap drawer is really well made.

Highly recommend.",Rejected
"I have used condenser dryers for years always with good results and when I needed to replace my old model the shop assistant sold me this machine on the basis of its environmental and cost saving qualities - what they didn't say is that it is so environmentally friendly that it doesn't dry your clothes and you have to wait for the rain to stop to hang them out to dry anyway! 

It's a disaster. In fact it's so bad that a consumer watchdog should intervene to stop Zanussi from selling this overpriced piece of rubbish.

 I only feel slightly better after that rant - it follows months of frustration with this beyond useless machine that is not a dryer - it just makes your clothes less damp after several hours in the machine (and I mean several hours).",Rejected
"The washing maschine is perfect, it has all the required programs. It is quite and it is really economic. A quality product on a good price.",Approved
"We've been extremely happy with this washing machine since we had it delivered from John Lewis three or four weeks ago.

It has a great variety of programs and is very quiet compared with my old machine. This is particularly important for us as the washing machine in our house is situated in an open plan kitchen diner.

The overall build quality is excellent, it's very easy to use. We use the 20 minutes quick was most days, and the clothes come out spotlessly clean even in such a short time",Rejected
"Water-No water

Got the machine this morning - did the ‘before first use’ run - water filled up nicely, programme ran normally, water drained away and then refilled, continuously - wouldn’t stop. Eventually managed to get it to drain and spin. Looked at our tap in case it was the issue - couldn’t see anything wrong there.  Tried to put on my first actual wash and now the machine says E10 - no water! Ridiculous.  There’s plenty of water flowing from the tap to the machine - just can’t seem to get in the machine.  Not impressed and the washing isn’t getting done!",Rejected

"This dryer is a newer version of my existing AEG dryer and shares many important features such as good build quality, up to 8kg capacity, a well-designed drum with very streamlined internal features, a wide range of programmes including a fast mixed load option and, of course, effective drying of different loads. 

The major difference is that this new dryer contains heat pump technology to make more efficient use of the heat created within the drying cycle by recirculation it further. This is immediately noticeable - no longer is a significant amount of waste heat outputted by the dryer into the room during use. This impression is backed up independently.

We have a Smart Meter to monitor our energy consumption. Our existing dryer immediately sends the indicator into the high end of the amber zone; by contrast the heat pump technology in this dryer means that the indicator remains well inside the green zone. Attempts to calculate electricity use suggest that this dryer uses around 55% of the energy of the previous dryer when in use and the overall saving may be greater since drying times also seem shorter; despite apparently long drying times displayed when a cycle is selected, the actual time taken is invariably shorter, sometimes significantly so.

I am grateful to AEG for the opportunity to review this dryer which will now replace our existing machine and I am confident that our electricity bills will reduce as a result while the quality AEG performance we have been used to will not just be maintained but enhanced.",Approved
"This is my second AEG oven , improved features it's is everything that I want from an oven",Approved
"Absolutely lousy as a toaster, switching one oven off without switching the other off is protracted. Touchpanel very hit and miss, have dampen by finger to get some of the controls to work",Approved
Excellent Product great features and lets you alter the programmes and timings would really recommend it,Approved
"The quietness of operation and the efficiency of the washing cycle are undeniable and excellent.
However the layout of the washing baskets leave much to be desired - the bottom basket in particular - it just doesn't seem to hold the same amount as my old one. One saucepan is about all I can manage to get in with a full load of dinner crockery and there are only two of us! I can't even get dinner plates side by side in the basket. Such a pity - it spoils the otherwise excellent performance.
I have a gripe about programming the wash - why can't it remember the last cycle - instead I have to keep pressing the program button four times at every use and I worry about the durability of the button.",Approved
"This is a replacement for my old AEG dryer, which had to be replaced for a condenser type as we moved house and had no external wall that we could place the dryer against.
It looks good, is really easy to use and gets my washing to the dryness that I want.
My only criticism is that the rounded door front means that it will not fit into the same space as my old machine as the door protrudes too far into the room for me to be able to shut the door into the room. So we need to have the door and frame moved - not an ideal scenario as I only wanted a machine not a house reconstruction",Approved
"I have had a number of dishwashers in my time including a very cheap one but this zanussi is by far the worst. It constantly leaves a residue of waste on the contents. I have tried different products but nothing seems to improve this so I have to hand wash items once they've been washed.
Unfortunately I would not recommend this product.",Approved
"As a Farmer's wife in the NE of Scotland I need a sturdy efficient hard working tumble drier. This fits the bill perfectly. I love the quality build and modern sleek look. The easy open door handle is wonderful for me as I have arthritis in my hands. Why has no one ever done this before? The drier is very quiet. I have it on in the utility room with the door open and can answer the phone or watch TV with no problem. The size is perfect. It fits where my previous drier went.
The water condenser is easy to empty and the fluff filter is the same.
The controls are intuitive and easy to operate. I have used this on all programmes and had perfect results every time including woollen jumpers . The large 8kg load easily dries my farm back door dirt trapper mat after washing. When I go back to the machine it is dry and no messing around.
Cheap to run quality efficient tumble drier for the busy household.",Approved

"This kettle boils quickly, has great features and is lovely to look at. It does however have one big issue, the water gauge is hidden behind the handle, for me this is a big nuisance as its only illuminated when power is switched on for heating. As it is I find it difficult to see the meter or judge the amount of water inside, unless I remove the kettle from its stand. The gauge should be on the side.",Approved
Like the kettle just one problem the lid could be removed to make filling easy.,Approved
"A nightmare, 4 rings, but front 2 space so small, already had 2 pans fall off. nearly a bad accident !!! Some sort of safety feature needs incorporating in hob. steel base not easy to clean, and shows every mark. With hindsight, would not have got it.",Rejected
"Nice smart fridge, good value. The door is quite hard to open!!! Esp for kids",Approved
"First impressions it is said are lasting ones, and I must say that the first impressions of this dryer were very good indeed, from the quality look and feel to the solid sound of the door closure, the water reservoir and fluff filter. If there was one thing that concerned us it was the complicated look of the electronic display screen and huge amount of choices, however from the first use I must say that this first impression was quickly forgotten - very intuitive and well thought out layout and so simple to use. 

With previous tumble dryers we have used, the heat belching out of the front and noise meant we had to close the kitchen door so as not to be reminded that the laundry was being dried, but with the 7000 Series SensiDry Technology, AEG have created a very quiet and energy efficient machine. No wall of heat from the front, instead the heat is chanelled back inside and reused, which also means our energy meter no longer glows red when the dryer is on. AEG claim that this technology means drying cycles will take longer, although I have to say this hasn't been noticeable. 

The ability to delay the start of the laundry drying is another great feature - we have solar panels on the house and any electrical product that can be set to run during daylight hours gets our vote. 

All in all a very impressive piece of kit, with large (8kg) load and A+ energy efficiency, and ultra quiet to boot. 

The only cautionary note would be to measure the depth of the machine before you decide to buy - it's 5 or 6cm deeper than our previous AEG machine and didn't fit behind the doors of our under counter place in the kitchen where our previous machine sat, meaning we had to remove the doors.",Approved
"Difficult to give an opinion ,our new machine had a faulty motor and needed replacing after 2 weeks of use.",Approved
I haven't seen as poorly designed dishwasher before. It is very difficult to position dishes as there is completely no adjustment functions. Lower basket tends to tilt backward if you are not really careful when filling or emptying it and very often falls out from rails. Very loud when dishwashing but do not signal the end of the cycle so you have no idea if it is still drying or stopped - it is built-in and there is no indicators outside so the only way to find is to open it. Dishes are not dried properly. Very poor quality plastic used inside. If it wasn't standard equipment of my newly built house I would never ever buy it. Extremely disappointed with such poor stuff manufactured by this brand.,Approved
"This fridge is good quality and feels expensive. Very spacious and great design. Huge salad drawer on sturdy runners. Down sides are that there is plenty of room for an additional shelf and I know a lot of other customers like myself have purchased an additional shelf. For the price, it should come with six shelves. Also, the back of the fridge is a little icy - I hope this isnt going to cause any problems.",Approved

I like in general the new design – big LCD screen with clear and easy to use controls, magnet door lock of condenser cover. 
The only thing I don’t like about new design is front cover of a water container drawer – it’s too big and it’s shape makes it little bit fiddly to operate, I preferred when it was nice and short. 

It has all the programs I need. “Refresh” programme is a nice addition which our old one didn’t have, so I was using “Time drying” programme, which wasn’t ideal. “Mixed” programme is a great addition too. 
Filter is easy accessible and easy to clean. The way how condenser compartment is made makes it easier to clean it too.

In my opinion the new model dries loads better then our previous dryer. Iron dry option gives better results than in our previous one. It has 8 kg capacity which is great for our family of 5 and I use it ones or twice a day. Excellent drying times and super non-creasing action. Pro Sense technology works great, very often reducing drying times and producing very good drying results at the same time. Delayed Start and Child Lock are useful options as well.
Overall it is a very good, strong built tumble dryer and I look forward to using it in the future.",Approved
"Replaced very reliable 1600 spin, 10 year old AEG washer dryer. Now require only a washer. This model discounted at Currys. Very quiet, with easy access door. Touch control panel very logical which enables personal settings of time, spin & temperature plus delay start. Very useful! Washing &1600 spinning very effective. Easy access to filter & drain pump. Time will tell if it proves as reliable as earlier one.",Rejected
Temperature control great and steam facility perfect. Love this iron.,Approved

"A great freezer - the right size, shape and does everything you would expect it to. And then about 3 weeks before it's 1 year anniversary, it appears the compressor has packed up. I now have the contents of said freezer scattered across the village in other people's freezers while I wait for the machinery of freezer maintenance and repair to slowly grind a solution out. Two and a half weeks later, and still not fixed (although compressor due next Tuesday). Still a chance that this replacement may not work in which case the whole thing will be replaced, timescales unknown...
Has not filled me with great love for the Zanussi brand, particularly when I have other machines from Hotpoint which are 12+ years old and going strong.",Rejected
We replaced two smaller chest freezers with this one because it was overall smaller in length and it does what we want brilliantly and is quiet and stylish.,Approved
Great item. Loads of room for all I need to stay cool.,Approved
This hob is the worst thing I have ever bought. I have only had it 2 months and it is already faulty. It is supposed to be 'super fast' but takes 3 and a half minutes to boil a kettle of water compared to 2 minutes in a electric kettle. I would certainly not recommend this product.,Approved
"This machine was a gift and replaced my previous AEG which was only 18 months old. The difference is that this machine uses heat pump technology so I was interested in finding out what this meant to the treatment of my washing. As far as I can tell, it dries as well, albeit seeming to take longer, although as it it an A+ rating it should be more economical than my previous one. It is lovely and quiet which if installed in a kitchen is a bonus. The downsides are few, I didn't like the door as it is just a pull action rather than a handle lock, and it has fewer drying options on the dial than my precious machine, but you can alter most of the options using the buttons to add to the dryness levels. As yet I haven't tried it to full capacity, it takes an 8kg load and even with a king sized quilt cover, sheet and pillowcases it didn't reach that, but I am sure it will cope, even though the drying time for that load was initially stated on the LED screen to be 2 hrs 57 mins it only actually too half that!",Approved
I bought this because it's larger than average and the door is larger with a handle you don't have to bend down to open. I am though disappointed to find that there is no tumble at the end of the spin which leaves clothes very creed if left in the machine.,Approved
The washing machine is easy to use. It has a variety of programmes. You can also reduce the time the machine will wash.,Approved
A good quality item quite in use and plenty of space for any size of food.,Approved
A good looking machine with complicated dials and instructions. Just can’t if to dry clothes. It might be me!,Approved
"I bought this item as a replacement for one which had died (Hotpoint). It fits well alongside the fridge, the only difference being the handles on the doors. I was especially looking for a model which was frost-free and this item has all the design features I need. Very impressed and I would highly recommend it.",Approved
"This is my first AEG laundry purchase and I am not disappointed. Dismissed it to start with as I thought it was too expensive but a Black Friday Special Deal allowed me to purchase it and I am so pleased I did as it has been really good. Plenty of different programmes to choose from and easy to follow instructions from the icons on the machine.
Only negative point is the website states that it is available with right or left door opening and mine arrived with the opposite to what I needed as it sits next to my washing machine and I wanted the doors to both open in the middle of the room.
The delivery men said that they were unable to change it!",Approved
"I paid more than I would normally pay on this product. I thought it would be amazing and come with amazing customer service,
The 2nd day I had it I accidentally closed the main door when one of the flaps was down. Now, I know this is my accident and a tad careless BUT when I opened the door again to find out why it wasnt closing I saw the entire door flap was shattered ! I didnt slam it, nor did I force it.
I called customer service to complain about the flimsy plastic and they refused to help. They couldnt even tell me if it was vital to the running of the freezer or not.
Im not too happy. My items may be frozen but It is now broken and I refuse to pay £25 extra for a new flap when they are so weak.",Rejected
"The freezer is now full of Christmas goodies and will be a great help with food storage.

However was disappointed that the light bulb in the freezer lid blew in the first week.( not sure if warranty would have covered light bulb).

I bought this freezer from John Lewis (delivery very efficient) in Nov 2014 and have tested it out in the unheated garage over winter before writing this review. Happy to say it works extremely well and efficiently with no build up of ice. I have had no problems at all with its operation in the unheated garage (this was my main requirement). The two top quick freeze shelves work well and the remaining drawers do not let out the cold too quickly when the door is open. I have given a 4* rating for features as it would have been nice to have had a built in light. The door does seal very efficiently and needs a gentle(ish) tug to open. I have no hesitation in recommending this freezer.,Rejected
"my last freezer was a Zanussi and after lasting the best part of 30 years i wanted another Zanussi. i wasn't disappointed, this freezer is excellent quality although because this freezer has 3 drawers i do feel a fair amount of space is wasted where atleast 1 or even 2 shelves with an idividual internal door would have utilised the internal space much better.",Approved
This is not a family home Hob and will turn it's ignition system work abruptly and short circuiting as well.,Rejected
"This machine replaced an AEG condenser model. We were expecting vastly increased drying times, but have been surprised to get similar times to our old model. When running it appears to use half the amount of electricity. The drum is 8kg vs 7kg in our old model. It does not sound a lot different, but seems to fit loads more, again saving more money. There is a linen cycle that works very well with quilt covers.

When using the tumble dryer the utility room becomes very steamed up and condensation forms on our glass door. This is with windows open and an extractor fan running. The room does not get warm and humid like it used to with our condenser - instead it is cold and humid. 

In summary, this is a good machine and appears efficient and relatively quick. It's just the high humidity it creates that is a concern.",Approved
"very bad experience, build quality and electric ignition does work if this is in use for more than 30 min. Zanussi maintenance team not able to fix in last 6 months, not sure why. still waiting for engineer's next visit.",Rejected
"My last experience of tumble driers came courtesy of my parents' early 1980's Hotpoint vented machine, so I wasn't looking forward to having this machine in my kitchen. However, I've been very pleasantly surprised. The machine is easy to use, thanks to its clear LED display and controls. The water tank is easy to access and empty, whilst energy usage has been susrprisingly low. I'd been warned that heat pump driers are quite slow to dry, but this one has been quite impressively quick and I love the Cupboard Dry + setting. Very impressed",Approved
"It performs exactly as expected. Almost perfect results. Need to redry some items on the mixed program. Overall, very impressed. Only snag, it does not fit fully under a 60cm worktop.",Approved

"A very nice looking tumble dryer, top quality, feels expensive as well. It is very efficient and really quiet. It doesn't produce too much heat as it is a heat pump. Additionally, clothes come out with much less wrinkles so we spend less time on the ironing board. Finally, it comes with 2 years full warranty which is peace of mind. I am very happy with the purchase and I highly recommend it.",Approved
Really good features quality not as good as expected.,Approved
so easy to use. nothing negative to say whatsoever. couldn't be happier with my purchase,Approved
"Drier was quick to set up and customise the the settings to how we wanted them. It uses heat and pump technology so much more energy efficient than a traditional tumble. We had heard heat and pump driers take an age to dry and clothes often remain slightly damp, however we didn't notice much time difference to a traditional machine and the clothes always dry. Also our clothes came out much softer and less creased than our previous drier. This gives the impression clothes are less likely to get damaged and also reduces the need for ironing - bonus! One negative is that small items, such as kids's socks tend to get stuck the door frame when tumbling. Making sure the machine is level helped this a bit.",Approved
"l like this hob becuase it is simple. No fancy wok burner etc and a clean design which would fit in with any kitchen. Safety is especially important to me and the fact that if the flame blows out the gas goes off is great. The hob was inexpensive, is easy to clean and is of good build quality. Compared to other hobs I have seen the price is very good and l recommend this to anyone who is looking for a smaller hob which will easily cope with the day to day cooking needs of the average family",Approved
"So many heat pump condenser dryers fail to dry adequately in the chase for an A+++ rating. Vented dryers do dry well (my previous dryer was a Bosch vented dryer) but do so with no care for your fabric. Luckily I found this dryer that dries brilliantly and with an A+ rating is still pretty good on energy usage. Easy to use, level of drying easily controlled from iron dry to completely dry, with sensor features to prevent damage to fabric. Plus it’s very well made: the delivery man commented that some dryers are pretty flimsy but not this one. Solid was his comment. Highly recommend this dryer. (No affiliation to AEG)",Approved
A great piece of kit. It is 200% better than our previous drier. The machine is easy to use and the clothes come out just right. A great acquisition .,Approved
"My favourite feature is that you can delay the start of the washing- so put it on before bed, and hang it up when you wake. The cycles are rather long, but okay with time saver mode- and it’s nice and quiet!",Approved
"I purchased this machine through Euronics, they were very helpful and really knew the functions of this dryer and gave good advice as this was the first condensing dryer I have purchase and there are so many different choice's
My last tumble dryer was a vented type and its 18 years old!! and still going !! If this machine doe's as well I will be very happy. If anyone lives in the Burton on Trent area contact Euronics ( Dave) absolutely the best man to give information on the product and arranged the delivery with a time slot --- although they were 2 minutes late !!!! When they did arrive the Guy's installed the dryer switch it on and went through the functions. First class service and a great tumble dryer. Thank you. June",Approved
I have always had Miele washing machines but I’m very pleased with my AEG so far. I just have problems doing the spin only option.,Approved
"A good product that is seriously let down by the fact that if any washing is put out on your washing line and just requires a few mins to air of in the tumble dryer, this machine will not accommodate and leave clothes damp to the touch. All well and good that it is cheap to run but when you factor in the time it take to dry the clothes straight from the washing machine and then to find that they have to be aired on an airer in the house somewhere. So overall, not impressed with this machine at all. If I could afford it, I would swap it for a vented dryer in an instant.",Approved
Replaced a Zanussi only three years made by same company but looks and feels much better quality. So far delighted with it and hope that this confidence is long lasting.,Approved
Just upgraded our dryer. Very pleased with our new appliance. Easy to use and looks the part.,Approved
"The hood itself is great, looks nice, works well and is good value compared with some other models. However, a couple of things to be aware of;
1. The sizes given on the website are misleading - the minimum installation height of 623mm appears to only apply when using it in extraction mode, if using in re circulation mode this minimum height increases to around 710mm. I ordered this product specifically because of the minimum height to suit my low ceiling, so was rather disappointed to find it wouldn't fit because of this issue, I had to have it modified to ensure the vents at the top of the chimney were not obstructed.
2. The method for fixing to the wall could be better. If you have nice flat walls it's probably ok, but if your walls are not flat it is quite frankly a right pain.",Approved
"I received this product as part of a package kitchen.When assembleing the product I found that the extendable chimney did not fit together properley and had to be replaced. I was assured by the agent that there was no problem with the part but even so they replaced it thank you. Also I was surprised that there is no flexable ducting supplied with the unit but is an added extra.
As for the value for money I have seen what appears to be an identicle unit less the brand name on the chimney for about half the Zanussi list price.The specification read the same as the Zanussi.",Approved
"cannot recommend a better machine, it's so quiet whilst spinning, the only noise is when it bleeps to say it's stopped. Every feature works like it should, the steam function is a godsend and the fact that it weighs the load before starting is great. Love AEG's our old one lasted 15yrs, but this is the best yet",Approved
"Working as per my expectations,ng quickly,energy saver, not effecting clothes.",Approved
"When our vented tumble dryer stopped working, I started looking for a new one. We are a big family of six so lots of washing & drying on a daily basis. After reading lots of reviews I decided to go for a heat pump condenser dryer. It's the most expensive option but I wasn't convinced to get another vented one. We used to hang the washing all over the radiators to get a better results than using our old dryer.

We bought the AEG T65370AH3 & wow! What a machine. Very quite & very impressive results. The washing are dry & not creased! Just fold & store. Never had to hang our clothes to dry again even in summer! We used it daily all year round.

Had the dryer for a year & a half and it's the same as the first day we got it. Very reliable machine so when I got the chance to upgrade to the newer model T7DEE835R I was very happy to get it. Bigger load of 8kg which is good for the amount of washing we have. Very quite & easy to use. Lots of programs to choose from. Delay start & beep when finishes. Very easy to empty the water tank & clean the filter. 

I would definitely recommend these AEG dryers to anyone who's looking for the best & reliable machines on the market. I'm very tempted now to replace all my other appliances to AEG!",Approved

Cottons : towels dried nicely, not over-dried
Bedlinen : duvet covers dried well with no creases, little ironing required
*Heat pump technology works very well and is energy efficient - uses about half the electricity compared to my previous machine",Approved

Very clear control panel which programmes easily. Fairly quiet when working. Great access through large door and love the large capacity.,Approved
Poor design of baskets for fitting in pans and bowls. Never dries properly. I bought this because I have an AGE washing machine and tumble drier which are excellent. Dishwasher is extremely disappointing.,Approved
"This was bought because it matches the washing machine and has a larger opening than most. I find it dries better when items are from the machine, fiddly when you just want to finish off. I don't find the synthetics program very good. All in all for a condenser better than most. Expensive compared to others.",Approved

"Love this washing machine. It replaced an old Bosch that had provided reliable service for 20-years and was a hard act to follow. But the new AEG beats it hands down: great wash, clothes dry much quicker thanks to faster spin speeds, but less creased. How did AEG achieve that?! Have used the steam and duvet cycles with great results. Its quiet too.
Gets 4 in the design category as the dispensing drawer feels a bit fragile compared to my old machine and I am concerned it might not be sufficiently robust to withstand some heavy-handed treatment by the men in the family. Survived so far but ..... Would have received a 5 otherwise",Approved
Delighted with machine. Drying time quicker than expected. No shrinkages. Highly recommend.,Approved
"I do not know how I managed with a dishwasher for so many years, would not be without it now",Approved
Unfortunately I had a Neff previously. This machine is not a patch on that. The internal racks are a very bad design. The door is very flimsy. Many things do not wash properly unless they are first rinsed.,Approved
"This is our third Zanussi Washer Drier in about 40 years and as we have always had no problems we have never considered any other make. Personally, I prefer the controls of the older one which were uncomplicated compared to the digital ones but that seems to be the norm these days also this new one has too many choices and I can’t see them all being needed. However I have tried a few different settings to match what I put in the wash and find they washed well. The fast spin gets clothes quite dry and the drier is perfect for towels.",Approved
"first time used the microwave function kept cutting out, then when using the fan oven the cooling fan was out of balance & noisy.
Turns out after engineer visit that the microwave cooling fan was faulty & not working at all causing the microwave to overheat. Fan for main oven was also replaced as it was stiff to turn and out of balance.
Not impressed that something we paid quite a bit to upgrade to from a standard second oven has had two repairs within the first week of use, so fault when installed.
also oven always has heavy condensation inside & has to be left open after use to dry out",Approved
"This is our second aeg , the last one was 20 years old and was still working .
There is so much advantage to this new machine which is , less power to run and, great choice of spin speed.",Approved
"This was to replace a 12 year old similar AEG model, supposedly of equivalent value,as part of an insurance plan. I wouldn't recommend it. The lower racks don't fold down, so not easy to load large pans, there is no floor light to indicate the machine is still washing (as its integrated you have to guess when it's finished) the upper rack - the flip up shelf arrangement doesn't hold wine glasses firmly and the bumps in the rack are in the wrong place, and the lower tray slides back when you open the door. It washes ok, but often leaves the dishes wet. Wish we could have kept the old one, which was just fine, but a part that was needed was obsolete. Feel like replacing it.",Approved
"I got the chance to review this product. It replaced my older model of the AEG 7th series dryer which I purchased in October 2015. I was very happy with the older model, it was my first dryer and it amazed me by efficiency, ease of use and the speed of drying.

Nevertheless, this new model is even better! It is hard to believe how wonderful my clothes, towels and bed linen feels and looks after being dried in this machine. The bed linen looks like ironed, the towels are extremely soft and the clothes don't have any static electricity as it used to have after the use of the older model. The drying time is very good, comparable with the older model. The filter is easy to clean and the condenser cleaning with the vacuum cleaner is much more efficient than with the older model, where I used to have to use ear cleaning buds to get all the dust out properly. The programmes are all very usable, I tried all of them, very impressed with the bed linen program as well as with the duvet program, it had no problem with drying our super king size duck dawn duvet and I love the way my dawn coat and jacket looks after using it. Another very useful feature is the refresh program, which is something I missed in my previous tumble dryer. I use it for refreshing clothes that was stored for long time, clothes that got in contact with smoke etc. I did find that although the jeans program is missing and I used to love it in my old tumble dryer, I don’t need it as the different thickness of clothes is not a problem for this dryer on any program, everything comes out dry, throw together shirts and towels with no problem, as well as jeans.

Overall, this dryer is a fantastic product and I would recommend it to anyone, it is easy to use, very efficient, speedy and very good looking. Only thing I was disappointed with is that there is no internal light despite it being stated as a feature on the AEG site. Only the 8th series has this feature. I do have my tumble dryer in a dark room without window and it would have been useful to have it.",Approved
Our existing washer dryer expired. We needed something to replace it and fit in the space vacated by our old unit. Dimensions were tight when looking at other manufacturers. This unit fitted the bill albeit protrudes slightly more than the old one but this does not distract from the fact that this is a suitable replacement. In that respect it fits the bill. The only downside is that the display does not indicate at which stage of the wash cycle the unit is performing! Not a bug bear but would have been nice to have. The dryer function is as good as the previous model. Overall a suitable replacement and more economical as it uses a cold feed only!,Approved
"A machine of excellent quality, well built, many useful features offering many different washes. We have only had the machine for a month and have used it several times a day. Items are always washed really well. Super design white with a grey finish. Stands out smartly and looks quality in the utility room. Has been well designed so you can see the items in the drum. Would definitely recommend this machine.",Approved
"I knew it was going to be hard to match my previous washing machine, but this machine seems to be nearly there. Looks good in my utility room. Washes quietly as I wanted. 1600 spin so less drying. A steam feature for less ironing but the washing is therefore wetter..no sure about that feature personally.. I miss not having a tilted drum the washing drops out as you fill it up but this is standard I guess. A 20 minutes 3kg quick was is handy.
Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase.",Approved

Started using my new AEG washing machine a few weeks ago now. I am finding it easy to use so far. The drawer for the powder etc is easy to remove for cleaning. Love the 20 minute cycle and use the main wash on time saver as well and everything is washing really well.,Approved
"This is a very good quality dishwasher which was supplied fitted in our new home. Standard options for a dishwasher but a neat feature I haven’t seen previously - when the wash cycle is finished, the door pops open which I guess aids the drying time and prevents water staining on glasses.",Approved
"I have only been using this fridge for a month but generally fairly quiet, keeps food chilled and spacious inside as far as integrated fridges go especially as frost free. It is used for one person, maybe rather small for a family. The interior light does not light up the fridge too well. inside The dairy compartment very flimsy either cracked on arrival or fitter broke assembling this in new kitchen. Zanussi were very good in replacing this straight away, thank you zanussi. A little pricey but imagine you get what you pay for.",Rejected
Purchased to replace our existing unit which had finally died. The layout is very similar and quality seems good. The only minor negative is the impractical split glass lids on the hydrator which fit very loosely and you have to remove anything stored on top to open them.,Approved
"Particularly pleased with new oven, quick to heat up easy to clean, attractive finish. Just a pity the instruction book wasn't a bit more user friendly, as not everybody has a university degree in deciphering overcomplicated instruction manuals. The end product of this is that I probably won't use this ovens features fully due to confusion.",Approved
User friendly and plenty of program options.So far so good ( but certainly better than the fridge!),Approved
"Very poor features for the money, delay program can only be set for 3 hours, no quick wash",Approved
"As in the phrase ""Silence is golden""... this machine is excellent. previous machine from a top manufacturer was starting to sound more like a machine gun on its spin... this is an absolute dream.

"We are restricted for space in our new flat, this narrow dishwasher was a great asset to the kitchen and it deals with a large load well.",Approved
"this fridge / freezer fits our needs perfectly. It has transparent drawers which makes it easy to find where you left things. It has a great guidebook which advises settings for winter / summer / normal weather conditions. The Zanussi fridge / freezer it was bought to replace lasted 15 years before only the fridge broke down, not the freezer. It' matches the rest of the kitchen as we have a Zanussi cooker, washing machine and tumble drier as well.",Approved
Love my new machine with its steam feature - very handy! Easy to use with its large door for loading and easy programming. It’s also very quiet - can highly recommend.,Approved
Chose this oven to replace an AEG product and as we have an AEG hob and also for the size of the top oven. The manual is difficult to understand and also the main oven door would not remain open. Having called out an engineer to investigate it would appear the problem is caused by a missing glass panel in the door. We now await the part and hope that cures the problem. Poor final inspection!!!!,Approved

"We were pleased to receive our new tumble dryer 14 days ago and so far have been impressed by it’s performance.

This is only the second tumble dryer we have ever had and again is an AEG so can only compare our new one with our previous model.

The first thing we have noticed with the new machine is that it is able to retain much more of it’s heat and is therefore much more efficient in it’s energy consumption (This is borne out by the specification which shows it consumes about 50% less electicity), although on the downside, some of the programmes seem to take a little longer. We also noticed on one occasion, with a light load of small items, one piece of laundry stuck on the bottom of the door opening for the rest of the drying cycle.

The controls are easy to use albeit there is a plethora of different combinations of programs available to choose from. The digital display is clear and easy to understand. The machine sensors work well and adjust the drying times appropriately.

The dried washing come out of the machine much cooler than from our old machine and has less of a smell of 'having been in a tumble dryer'. One must assume that washing not subjected to such intense heat must be better for the longevity and durability of the washing.",Approved
Love my replacement oven from aeg. Had an older version for quite a number of years. Love the double fan oven. Haven’t found anything I don’t like about it.,Approved
"My last AEG washer lasted 15 years with only a couple of call outs for minor problems. Only had this washer for a few months and I am very well pleased with its cleaning and the various programmes. The quality build is good.

My only problem is that I bought some AEG anti vibration cups for the washer feet but once fitted you can't move the washer. Still working on this.",Approved
"I love this fridge and am extremely pleased with the product. It does however have one very frustrating feature and this is the vegetable boxes at the bottom. The lid of the boxes are shelving but to get into the boxes, I have to remove everything off the shelf.",Approved
"This dryer does not seem to shrink my laundry so far like all my other dryers have done. so I am pleased about that.
The appearance could be better, a bit dated looking. especially the big round program knob.
It does not crease my laundry too much compared to other dryers I have owned. but I always put less in so that it has room to tumble freely.
I would recommend this dryer but i wish now that I had of purchased the more expensive Total Care dryer.",Approved
"Great product,however need some simple/mechanic option to simply turn it on and off for a period of time of my choosing,seems I don't have it.",Approved
"I have recently been asked to trial the T7AEG835R and have now been using it for three weeks. We previously had the 65370AH which is a more basic heat pump model that we were very happy with.
The T7DEE835R is on another level all together. It is quieter (just a short minimal extra noise on start up when compressor kicks in). It dries the clothes a lot quicker, at least an hour, than the previous model. It dries waterproof bedding perfectly which the previous machine struggled with. The controls are simple with more drying options with a great setting that you can adjust default dryness level. The buzzer is not too loud and you can turn it off completely. The design is pleasing with a glass front that enables you to see if items get tangled which was not possible in our older machine and sometimes meant items left damp. The drying sensors are better and more efficient. There seems to be less lint collected which means better care of clothing. The digital display shows when to empty the water tray and clean the filter and also reminds you to check and clean the heat exchanger. The extra 1kg loading to 8kg and drum size I believe has also helped with drying times but also great for bedding.
All in all, I cannot fault the machine - Congratulations AEG",Approved
"Controls are clear and easy to use.
Filters and tank are easily accessible and easy to clean.
Child safety option.
Energy efficient.
The only draw back is that a single cycle is not sufficient to dry the clothes properly specifically for heavy clothes like jeans.",Approved
Beautiful machine that exceeds all my expectations a wide range of programs to suit all fabrics. Gives different options for levels of dryness which is really useful. Large capacity drum means it copes with the largest of loads with ease. Have already recommended this machine to family and friends.,Approved
"Disappointed to be honest, brand new hob that came with a new build house. Despire only using it for a month or so and cleaning with soapy water as recommended it has developed slight rusting. Not what I expect from a new hob",Approved
"would have given a 5* but the instructions for electrical connections were absent and when received, not very clear. Having said that, both the performance and quality of the product is great and I will have no hesitation in recommending this to anyone. 
Only other comment is about the induction controls which are overly sensitive.
Please AEG do include the details for electrical connections in the instructions manual",Approved
"I love this hob, the best I have ever had. I cook for a living and cannot wait to use this at home. Excellent AEG!",Approved
"This hob replaced an AEG ceramic hob which had given 10 years great service and never failed. I chose this particular hob after reading good reviews. I had never used an induction hob before so wondered if I was doing the right thing as I has to get rid of a few pans which weren’t suitable. However, the speed is awesome, control is immediate and it’s so easy to keep clean, I absolutely love it. No regrets!",Approved

"Very new, so not much experience with it yet, but the reason for my entry is moan about the apology for a grill pan that comes with the oven. you would be lucky to fit 2 sausages on it!

"Spacious, quiet and well made, at a very reasonable price.",Approved

"I am really pleased with my purchase. The tumble drier is excellent and it does the job. Plenty of programs and not complicated at all to use. Not too noisy, and it dries the clothes according to your requirements.",Approved
This is the second identical hob we have bought. The only reason for the second hob is we moved home and left our first one behind.,Approved
"This review is as much to with AEG as the product. When you go online to register the product it only gives you 2 years so i would recommend calling registration dept and they will amend it to five. Build quality and design are good, this is my second AEG machine the first lasted 12 years. The customer would have a better user experience if they just published the correct telephone numbers for the correct departments and lost the silly mood music. Please take a leaf out of John Lewis book on how to do things right. Bought from AO.com because of free next day delivery and price.",Rejected
"I was looking to replace my gorenje fridge with one of similar dimensions and came across this fridge. I was even more happy to but it as it had gone down in price.
When we unpacked it I was so disappointed and still feel this way. Even though the dimensions indicate a large fridge it is very deceiving.
The shelves are very small and look very flimsy I'm worried when I put things on like heavy bottles onto them. The depth of the shelves is ridiculous.
We are a family of 7 and our weekly shop has to be done in two parts as it just doesn't fit in the fridge.
The vegetable box at the bottom can hold a large cabbage without lifting the shelf above it. There is no compartment for cheese.
I really dislike this fridge it's very good looking but open it and it's disappointing.
I wish I had sent it back but couldn't because we would have been without a fridge",Approved
"clear easy to understand controls, good wash quality with low noise excellent programmes clean design lines we like our purchase,",Approved
"I am very happy with this purchase. I live in 1 bed apartment and thankfully the Product is very quite. It dries 6.5 kg load in 1 hour 25 min. I have wash machine with 6.5 kg capacity and and dryer has 8 kg capacity which makes drying very easy and quick.

User interface is very is to operate. Cleaning the filter and emptying the water tank is so easy.

You need make sure you have a good washing machine, cos if you use spin and make sure the clothes are not so wet then dryer does the excellent job.

It did dried towels in 1 hour 40 min and they were not only dry but hot and smelt nice.

I would recommend to any body.

ps: It suppose to com with 5 year warranty as per Currys website but when i try to register online on AEG website it says 2 year warranty. so i need to call in to confirm warranty length.",Approved
I can’t believe how good this machine works. It takes all the effort out of washing with some many choices of programs.,Approved

Excellent drier. Clothes come out really soft with very few creases.,Approved
"Machine looks good, love the digital timer. I use the 30 minute quick wash a lot, but has other cycles that I use as well. Really like this machine. The delay cycle comes in very handy",Approved
This machine replaced one I had for years and I am very pleased with it.,Approved
"I bought AEG freestanding A++ rated tumble dryer T865801H a year ago for GBP663. I am extremely dissatisfied with the product because it normally takes 4-5 hours to dry a 3kg load of bedsheets or towels on the highest possible drying heat and spin. This has been frustrating and inefficient in terms of energy consumption. I have a 5 year guarantee for this appliance which I tried to use. An AEG engineer inspected the product and told me there was nothing wrong with it; he charged me GBP125 for the visit which did not solve the issue. This is a very expensive dryer and clearly should not be priced and marketed as an energy efficient dryer due to its poor performance and inefficiency. I used to own a C+ rated dryer which I had bought for GBP150 and it dried a similar load of clothes 4 times faster! What a gross representation on behalf of AEG. Moreover, there is no customer service of any kind after you have bought the appliance or basic willingness to acknowledge that the appliance is either faulty or inefficient. I am stuck with it. Do not waste your money on this product. Go for Bosch.",Rejected
"This was a replacement for a Samsung which seemingly has to be installed on a concrete floor.... no such issues here great wide door and drum make loading easy, good choice of programs especially like the quick ones, and it's spin is super quiet, I sometimes forget that it's been on... great product",Approved
"Not sure how I ever lived without this laundry aid. Huge drum, eco setup and dry washing. I love it!",Approved
Sad to say the motor has seized up thankfully well within the guarantee period. Not too promising for a long working life. Otherwise has worked well.,Approved
Not at all happy with my fridge as it seems to have a constant water inside it as it should be self defrosting I don't know why the water gathers under the boxes in the fridge,Approved
The product is fast and economical. Quiet and beautiful Also the product with a variety of options including dry cleaning. Really fun of a clothes dryer,Approved
"Bought this tumble drier to replace our old one. Can't believe how much quieter and how quick it drys compared to our old one!! With the reliability of Zanussi, an all round excellent purchase.",Approved
"Great washer dryer, very quiet and looks great. Large capacity and overall a good quality product. Would definitely recommend.",Approved
Having had zanussi apliances before I thought it was a make I could trust but was mistaken. After 3 months of use its developed a leak at the rear which has ruined a wooden floor. The engineer is due to call with a replacement motor for the fan which is so noisey it can be heard in the bedroom. The door material is very flimsy in that the handle of the door almost comes off because of the vacuum that is inside the fridge making very difficult to open the door. We paid over £450 for this and after only 3 months of use we are very tempted to send it to the tip. Would never buy a zanussi apliance again,Rejected
"I purchased this fridge/freezer over a year ago and after 2 months it broke completely. Engineers have been out 4 times since and it has never gone more than a few weeks without breaking. Currently broken and Zanussi have been less than useless. Customer care worse than the product. Can never get through on the phones, and by email a different person replies each time, going back to square 1. After 3 weeks of trying I have now given up and will be disposing of my 13 month old, £300 appliance.",Rejected
First class product at a not unreasonable price. Superbly controllable cooking at your fingertips. Thoroughly recommended.,Approved
"I purchased in 22 Dec 2014 from Currys following reading several reviews - delivered on 3rd February apparently waiting on unit to be manufactured. It worked for 10 to 11 weeks and did dry clothes very well and was quiet in operation then no longer dried clothes in mid April. The good weather in April resulted in limited usage so the issue was not immediately apparent.

Basically the unit would work for 5 mins and then stop the cycle without any notification. I contacted AEG 8th May who routed me to a service company that took a week to attend to site, engineer stated that he had reset the unit and it should be okay now 15th May. Did not use the machine until end of the following week Saturday 23rd May again it did the same not drying clothes and stopped after 5 mins.

I contacted AEG again who were not interested in an exchange, I did escalate but AEG insisted that another engineer needs to attend to the machine, 28th May as I write the review, waiting on the engineer, maybe this time it will be fixed.

Quite simply having paid £749 for the unit which has failed so quickly indicates that the unit is not fit for purpose.

I would not recommend following my experience and it makes me suspect that the longevity of the unit will be somewhat compromised.

I should have purchased that well know German manufacturer starting with M, the same as my functioning dishwasher of 10 years with no problems.",Rejected
"This washer is ok I like the 20min wash for lightly soiled clothes.
I am not keen on the 1400rpm some of the cycles only spin at 1200. Ive been used to 1800rpm.
Its an ugly looking machine and not top quality like my previous machine.",Approved
"The  main criticsium of  the apliance is that the child lock is pointless, as it doesnt lock power switch.
wich is a seriouse design fault. and can not realy claim to have a child lock function.
Other than that the machine has worked flawlessly.
but we have to keep our toddler out of kitchen when in use.",Approved
"A great oven that is a bit Tardis like! Loads of room, and accurate temperature. I've not baked in it yet, but very confident it will be perfect. The dials that push in are fab, makes the whole unit look very sleek. It was easy to fit - I had an electrician fit it but it can be done by a competent DIY-er - and fits a standard housing unit. It does chuck out a big burst of heat when you open it but you get used to this. All round, a great oven. Looks good, performs well, and is fantastic value for money.",Approved
"Bought two years ago, now packed in and not economic to repair!! Our last fridge freezer lasted >10 years & so did the one before that (& it was 2nd hand!). We chose this thinking that Zanussi was a reliable make, how wrong that was! I am really unhappy. What is the point of buying an ""energy efficient"" unit if it only lasts 2 yrs .... the emissions during manufacturing & disposal far eclipse operating emissions ... if you average emissions over the product lifecycle this isn't an A. The ""appliance of science""? they should have applied a bit of engineering. Anyway, if the woeful lack of robustness isn't enough to put you off, it only has one vegetable drawer ... twin drawers are miles better. If you must go for this model, factor in the cost of an extended warranty / or replacing it every 2 years.",Approved
"First time purchaser of a tumble dryer. I have to say I am very pleased with my purchase. 

The drum is big and easy to load and empty. The filter and water tray are also easy to maintain. 

The dryer is efficient and dries my washing far faster than, the original time on the display. 

If you are looking for an energy efficient dryer, I would recommend this one.",Approved

Very easy to clean filters and overall happy with purchase.",Approved
"Excellent range of options. Love the spin speeds. In comparison to the last washer, the cloths come out dryer - which means less time in the tumbler ... which means money saved. Love this little guy.",Approved
Excellent product. Very happy with the wash. Built is very solid. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good washing machine,Approved
"Bought with matching washing, thought AEG a good brand? Both machines have failed within 30 days and the washing machine replaced. This Tumble dyer AEG refused to take back and has left us with a wet floor ever since. They do not answer their emails and customer service is a shambles, oh and forget trying to register the warranty on this site because they don't acknowledge that either. Never, Never buy AEG appliance again. In fact just buy anything else.",Rejected
A great easy to use cooker with lots of great features. A perfect addition to my new kitchen.,Approved

"We carefully researched and chose this model. I have never seen my wife so pleased with an item of technology, it's almost a pleasure to use it.",Approved
Good it is reable it does not took much electrisity it has good features,Approved
"This AEG condenser tumble dryer is very attractive and stylish with a glass window door front which allows you to see the clothes etc., and check on their progress in the drying cycle. There are several drying programmes to choose from and the large 9kg drum capacity is excellent particularly when drying bedding and towels as they have plenty of room to move around in the drum. There is a digital display which tells you the time of the drying cycle and an alarm sounds when the cycle has finished.
The dryer calculates the drying time and will end the cycle when the clothes are dry. There are extra programme choices to select for iron dry and cupboard dry. The dryer is quiet during operation and overall I would recommend this Tumble Dryer .",Approved
"Good looking, Rapid to required heat setting, Good even cooking at a great price! It's all I need in an oven!",Approved
"I bought this particular model in spain,very clean looking and easy to clean but I find the instruction book detailing various settings very confusing. What is true fan cooking? Adjusting recipe timings is quite difficult. Any thougts on this would be appreciated",Approved
I like the quick wash feature. Some programmes are a bit long but can be reduced.,Approved

"For ''seniors'', buying a quality oven is a major purchase. Spending a lot of money on something that may outlast them takes faith in the value. We made no mistake. Having done research on Which and other sites we decided on this model. Sleek and modern looking, it performs impeccably. We have not used all of it's functions and capabilities yet, we cannot think of anything we want that this cannot do. In short, this appliance performs as brilliantly as it looks and is easy to keep clean. Highly recommended, but you'd expect that from Zanussi, still the appliance of science if you will pardon the plagiarism.",Approved
"super product, excellent design, excellent features, excellent quality",Approved

"Having read reviews from John Lewis site I was wondering if I had made the right decision, but found that some of the negative comments had resulted from buyers not fully investigating the features of the machine. I can do almost all the things that I could do with my old Zanussi machine and it is much more flexible. Three negative comments are 1) that the door of the washing liquid tray seems rather thin and wobbly and is very stiff to move; 2) it is not possible to do a hand or wool wash without a spin, which I could do in the Zanussi and is required by some garments; 3) the response of all the buttons, including the on/off button is very slow and can then race through options, past the one I want.",Rejected
This machine takes too long to wash. The manual is misleading as times quoted are for half laods but the machine has an 8kg drum. I did a normally load and it took 2 1/2 hours. so to me three lots of bedding would take nearly 9 hours. (sorry did not weight before I washed!!!) the online info on this site says a reduction of up to 50% on a wash time. I had an engineer out to me three days after purchase as took so long to wash and he advised the quick wash button only reducues the rinse time . Do not buy this machine unless you live alone no good for families who need to wash a few loads at a time,Approved
"Best washing machine I've every had, slightly expensive but well worth it. Very quiet when filling with water and the spin cycle even on the 1600 spin is not noticeable. Would recommend this product to friends and family, even bought the heat pump dryer.",Approved
Excellent choice of programs and easy to use. Looks very smart in kitchen too,Approved
Appears to be a well made machine. Certainly runs quieter than the previous washing machine we had. Seems to be a well balanced tub. Does a good job getting things clean but wash cycle is a little slow. Overall recommended buy.,Approved
"This machine has a tall drum wich is shallower than our previous machine, this makes it very much easier to unload (we don't have to get down on all fours now!) The quick wash is so good we hardly ever use the other programs. Best of all you can use lower spin speeds which mean your washing does not come ouot all screwed up. Machine is quiet and washes excellently.",Approved
"It drys your washing very quietly. I can not complain, it’s a quality product and no mistake.",Approved
"Fridge is always full of water, freezer full of ice as if it has thawed out. Noisy compressor.

Excellent product.Great quality. Silent work. I would recommend it.,Approved
This washing machine has changed our lives! We live in a very small flat so drying our clothes has been a nightmare in the winter until now. Setting this on a wash and dry cycle means that our washing can be done in hours - and it is much more clean than in the old machine :),Approved
"The heat pump makes this cool running and I have found it very efficient if not fully loaded. Really like it, perfect results so far.",Approved
"Fits all my requirements, particularly the reversing drum action. Economical to run",Approved
"This washer dryer is one of the finest machines I've ever used. The programmes are excellent and easy to understand. The revolution speed is one of the best features of this machine, being 1600rpm clothes come out in a dryer state than with lesser speeds and makes drying clothes easier aswell. The machine is quiet even at full speed. The capacity of this machine is good and the professional weight indicator let's you know if you have gone over.",Approved
"Excellent build, capacious, easy to use, fabulous performance in all cycles.",Approved
"Replaced a very loud machine. 
How it works out the load and adjusts wash time is brilliant and saves energy.",Approved
"I would say to anyone buying from Zanussi please be very careful. I have bought a fridge/freezer and the door is faulty, although I realise my first redress is with the retailer. I did contact Zanussi to tell them the problem and I thought (niavely obviously) that they would want to help!!l

My experience with them was appalling and very unprofessional, I was asked to send a photograph of the fault, which I did. Then I was asked to send it again which I did, now I have not heard anything from them. My warranty would cover the repair of the item but surprise Zanussi have not got back to me to offer to repair the item,

I am so fed up that I just want my money back and am having to get legal advice, so I now have an unusable fridge/freezer sitting in my utility room.

You only find how good a manufacturer is when a situation needs to be corrected, and my experience shows keep well clear of any Zanussi product.",Rejected
"I’ve been using the washer dryer for over a month now and I have been very satisfied with it. 
The machine will look smart in any kitchen. It has lots of options and the best thing about it is that it weights the clothes once you have loaded it and adjusts the washing time. The end result is perfect every time. It has a good few options for washing different fabrics. It is fairly quiet as well but noise goes up when in full spin. It’s a huge machine so it has been perfect for a family of 4 we are. The dryer is handy for small loads. We have not used it to dry a full 6kg load as it takes long time but we did not purchase it for that. We got it to wash big loads and to dry a few items when they are needed straight away. We got it for a very good price so it has been well worth having it. I would definitely recommend buying the machine!",Approved
"I bought this fridge freezer as the capacity was very good for the price. However after 12 months of use I find I now have to look for new freezer drawers, everyone of the four have cracked, this is down to the poor quality of plastic used which becomes brittle at low temperatures. The fridge door compartment has also cracked. Would not recommend.",Approved
"I have had the dryer for several weeks and cannot recommend this product enough. It looks amazing, has a large 8kg load capacity and is very quiet. It is a Heat Pump dryer which has a A++ energy rating and is very economical as it dries fabrics at half the temperature of conventional dryers. It has a great range of programmes to suit every family need. The Absolute Care system of programmes controls the movement and temperature of the drying cycle preventing shrinkage, maintaining shape and restoring waterproofing. The precise drum movement keeps woollens flat against the drum to replicate flat drying. I cannot fault this product in anyway. It ticks all the boxes.",Approved
"This is a workhorse of a dryer. It oozes quality. There are no gimmicks. Woollens dried beautifully but took 2 hrs. Towels came out very soft, without using softener in the wash. Sweat shirts don’t need any ironing, but cotton polo shirts need to have some creases removed. One tip! If you need to touch two of the touch sensors to change settings, e.g. the child lock, use two fingers from the same hand. It works much better. I don’t know why. A great product.",Approved
"First impressions, looks good and is reasonably priced. Runs quietly and there's a lot of storage space in freezer. However, both fridge and freezer parts have been frosting up despite the product being advertised as frost free. Also one of the freezer drawers has broken after only 4 months of use! I am having to pay for a replacement as Zanussi say that the detachable parts are not covered under warranty.",Rejected
"Bought washing machine and tumble dryer from the 9000 series. It’s quiet and washes very well, lots of functions. Pro steam function really works- as bedlinen easier to iron afterwards. Highly recommended",Approved
"I am proud to say that I am a very happy owner of the AEG 8000 Series Heat pump dryer with Smart technology. The look, styling and capability of this dryer is second to non. It also sits next to and compliments my new AEG Washing machine which also has smart tech. The drying capacity is huge not only in relation to the amount of clothes the drum can hold but also the many drying options that are available to you (the refresh option is most useful). The fact that a light comes on inside the drum when you open the door is also a great feature (no more lost socks). Another useful feature the designers have incorporated is the ease in which you can empty the water. The fully compact container is positioned above the drum so there is no need to bend down !! Regarding the app this too is extremely user friendly and what I really love is the way that you are told how long the drying cycle you have selected will take and the actual time it will finish - genius. My laundry has never felt so soft - no more hard towels or scratchy jumpers. The dryer operates so quietly too. As with my washing machine, this is another quality product and worth paying extra for. How times have changed. I never thought I'd be carrying out the washing and drying chores via an app on my phone whilst sitting my lounge but I can honestly say that 'doing the laundry is no longer a chore and the finished result are great.",Rejected
So I bought the dryer on 13th of november. I've used it around 10 times and it just stop working. Authorized mechanic indentify that the engine is broken.

"Some really good features, can't believe it can boil water quicker than a brand new kettle",Approved
"I spent a lot of time researching for the best fit of washing machine for us, I'm so glad I went with AEG it was recommended to me and has not disappointed. Variety of wash options covers all bases, soft water technology is fantastic, clothes are coming out perfectly clean and the machine is quiet. 1600rpm spin is ideal so that clothes dry quickly, the machine also looks fantastic and matches the dryer perfectly. Capacity is brilliant for our family of 4. I'm confident this machine is going to last us a long time.",Approved
"My first AEG tumble dryer and very pleased so far. Good features, not too loud and very easy to empty the water and clean the filter. Mainly using one setting and clothes come out dry everytime.",Approved
"The good features of the machine is that it can do a 40 degree wash on a quick 47 min wash. I tend to do most of my washes using this programme.
When the wash has finished , it has the facility to do a 1600 spin in 17 mins. For a ""freshen "" wash, it will do a 30 min wash , and again , can do a separate 1600 spin.
On the whole, it is an easy to use machine, good selection of user friendly programmes and good value for money.
On the negative point however, at the end of a wash or spin, it has an annoying ear piercing beeping noise. it wouldn't be too bad if it only beeped once, but it must beep about 8 times !!! Annoying !",Approved

Lots of different programmes, but we generally use cotton which takes about 2 hours 20 mins for a 7 kilo load.
Don't know as regards to power consumption as we haven't had it long enough yet.",Approved
"This model does not seem to be as good as the one it replaced that we used for 11 years, the cooler washes [60 & below] do not get dishes sparkling clean and the dishes do not dry as well as before, but it is still better than standing at the sink!",Approved
"Noisy,poor shelving layout,
Drawers have sharp edges.
No amount of adjusting fridge temperature stops the constant running water making everything wet.
All round disappointment.",Approved
Previously had an AEG washer dryer combined for many years. This dryer is so much better then previous one. Can dry a whole load and it actually comes out dry. Cannot recommend highly enough. Very impressed love it.,Approved
"The quietest tumble drier I've ever heard (or not heard).

The machine is well-designed, easy to use and whilst it has a lot of additional features the basic settings are largely all you'll need. 

It's well built, nicely designed (and complements my washing machine as an added benefit) and the fluff collection system is the best I've seen.",Approved
"Generally quire a good product but the wash cycles are far greater than any washing machine we have had previously. Spinning is always an uncertain option as it will tumble and do a minor spin for something like half an hour or more and then sometimes it will just stop and on other times it will spin but not necessarily at maximum spin speed. Quite frustrating, particularly if you are waiting to go out, you would never be sure what you would come home to if it was left running.",Approved
"Very easy to use, love it.Would recommend to anyone",Approved
The AEG dryer is amazing. I have had dryers in the passed which where energy hungry and where a let down when drying clothes leaving the wet. I have been using the AEG dryer for only a few weeks and have found it more then capable of drying delicate cloths without any problems whatsoever. I highly recommend this product.,Approved
"This is so controllable it's unreal. So quick and easy to use. After years of cooking with a halogen hob and coming to the induction i must have been nuts not to try sooner. I love cooking and this just makes things so much easier. To get food boiling within seconds is no exaggeration. Great features like the timer on separate plates which turn off when time is up. I'm sure you won't be disappointed, I'm certainly not.",Approved
"This was a replacement for my hob which broke(different manufacturer) and I am delighted with it. Easy to use, no unnecessary gimmicks, no problems so far and was very pleased with the reasonable price. Would recommend it.",Approved
"When my old fridge freezer broke down I searched in vain for a like-for-like replacement. It was impossible to find a f/f that had the same features; 4 drawers in the freezer section, a flip-up section in bottom shelf of the fridge to accommodate tall items, adjustable shelves and containers in the fridge - and all in a unit measuring no more than 177cm in height. My kitchen has a sloping roof so height is an issue. I thought your fridge freezer was the closest fit and compromised on 3 freezer drawers. However although the external width is 58cm (same as my old f/f) the internal drawer width is only 38cm compared to 48cm. So storage space is severely compromised and forever having to move things to reach the required items and unable to store as nearly as much. Products left at the back of the fridge get wet from the melted ice that forms on the back wall; chocolate develops a white bloom (not with old f/f). It also makes an annoying vibrating noise, coming from the left hand wall of the fridge. Why can manufacturers not make a 4 drawer f/f that is less that 200cm high? We don't all have space for these.",Approved
"I own the predecessor to this appliance (the Zanussi ZRB32313WA)

I initially bought this fridge, back in September 2013, because of the limited width my kitchen has available.
At 59.5cm wide, it really does ‘just’ fit into the space. (A 60cm wide fridge would be scratched if forced into the space.)

When I first started to search for a fridge-freezer, I was concerned that I would be limited to a few options, of basic machine with awful specifications and possibly cheap quality.
During my search, I found the Zanussi range offered this perfect width, but was also a high-spec’ machine (with a high energy rating of A+) but was also generous with internal space. It wasn’t cheap either at £419.99 I was buying something better than average.

I found that various sellers actually sell this same machine under variations of the same model number – the differences between each ‘version’ was as simple as the graphics stuck on the drawers, or how many plastic shelves are supplied for the fridge compartment.

The machine was bought locally from a Euronics store and was specially ordered in. It was delivered a few days later. It fitted perfectly into that 59.5cm space I had for it.
Perfect. When it use it made those ‘common’ fridge-freezer sounds, like bussing and the occasional crack. (At first these were alarming but there was a guide with the instructions that cleverly demonstrate the various noises the machine will make.)

I found the internal space fantastic for my needs:
For the fridge, a couple of bottles of wine in the rack, plenty of door shelving for my fruit juice, dairy items, and the two drawers fine for my vegetables. The rest of the trays held various other things like jams and chutneys.
For the freezer, the three drawers were great for storing meat and stock. For a single person, I could easily store a month’s work of meat and frozen veg.

Then after 7 months of use, in April 2014, the machine stopped working. I went away to a relatives on Friday night and returned on the Sunday to find the machine silent.
I opened the fridge to find it warm, and smelly – food was rotting. I opened the freezer to find it barely cold, and the meat had thawed out. All that food had to be thrown out. I wasn’t happy. I contacted the seller, who passed me onto Zanussi.
The machine has a 12-month warranty, and so an engineer came out a couple of days later. He repaired the machine within about an hour, and essentially ‘re-gassed’ the appliance. A few hours later it was all back up and running, and I could get about re-stocking it with food. All was fine.

It turned one year old in September 2014, and so the warranty expired.

At the end of November 2014, at 14 months old, I returned from a couple of nights away. It was Sunday afternoon and I returned to find machine has stopped working again. This is 7 month after the initial repair. I wasn’t happy, and also very aware that the warranty had expired.
As with the first failure, the machine was silent. Once again, the fridge was warm (warmer than the actual kitchen) and stinky. And once again, the freezer was full of thawed meat, and warm, too. And once again I threw away a lot of spoiled food.

I contacted Zanussi on the Monday morning. During that day, I made three phone-calls (each lasting around 30 minutes). I explained the problem, and was advised that an out-of-warranty service would be £115. I refused to pay this given the age of the machine, and the fact it had already failed once before. I asked to speak to someone about a replacement machine, and was advised I’d be called back. This happened for the first two phone-calls – as nobody returned my call.
The third call was pretty much the same, expect this time it was 5.15pm and most of the office had left for the day. I was given the Customer Care email address and advised to write in.

So, that Monday evening I emailed the Zanussi/Electrolux Customer Care department and explained exactly what had happened. I also sent this email to my local Euronics store as well as the main Euronics customer service email.

A week has no passed, and it’s early December (writing this review on 6th December).
In that time I have not had any response from Zanussi, nothing from Euronics, and one call from my local Euronics store that have supposedly contacted Zanussi themselves. I even contacted Zanussi UK via Facebook and Twitter, who have simply passed my contact details to the Customer care team.

Having spent over £400 on an appliance, I would expect it to last well beyond 14 months. (My previous fridge-freezer was a Hotpoint, cost £400, and lasted me 3 years before I sold it with my flat to the new owner.)
I appreciate that machines do fail, and that is why we have warranty periods, but the value of the product also implies its quality. This machine hasn’t lived up to its retail value.
Also, given the age of the appliance, the customer should not be willing to pay out £115 to repair a fault that has occurred twice. In both cases I’ve been forced to throw away food that was never reimbursed, so why should I keep losing money for a faulty product?

The appalling level of customer service is simply unprofessional. I find it infuriating that customers can be treated this way – if I treated customers in this manner, I would be fired with immediate effect.

So, given my rant, do I recommend this machine? No.
Would I look at buying anything from Zanussi again? No.

Stay away from this product, and possibly any fridge-freezer produced by Zanussi, unless you really like throwing money away and receiving the worst possible customer experience.",Rejected
I would tell people to buy one. very pleased with this product.,Approved
"There's loads of space. Deep crisper drawers and likewise in the freezer. The trouble is they're not made of strong enough plastic to cope with the weight their size gives them, so be very careful or you'll snap them as we did, leaving sharp edges.

The extra cool drawer in the fridge is very useful and works great (especially when combined with the extra cool button) but can easily come out of its drawer runs which is just annoying.

Overall though, really pleased. So much space for our family of four's groceries.",Approved
"This is my second heatpump dryer, the first again from a well known manufacturer that came with a 5 year guarantee, but was noisy & extremely slow at drying. It used half the electricity but took three times as long so noneffective, especially for a family of 4 with two teenagers. It drove my wife mad who drove me mad about it. So much so I replaced it after 2 years with an AEG device. Having been very disappointed first time round and spent a lot of money I did many hours of research before settling on this model. 
We've now had the dryer nearly two months and it has had virtually daily use. It was very straightforward to understand and program and the results were outstanding. A quiet and efficient dryer that we haven't been disappointed with and one happy wife.",Approved
"The controls slide, so it’s easy to set an exact temperature.",Approved
"The hob looks very sleek and the smooth lines make it very easy to keep clean.  The Maxisense feature means that you only heat the precise size and shape of the pan so no wasted power.  Induction is really great, it heats things up super fast and then gives great control when simmering etc.  I’m also really impressed how evenly and consistently the pan heats up.  No hot or cold spots and a nice even cooking surface all over.  I love the hob and can highly recommend it.",Approved
"Excellent washing machine performance, handles large/small loads of washing with ease as it self adjusts the programmes to optimise the wash cycle, so saving you time and money.
This machine is so quiet even in the spin cycle. The only thing which may cause an issue is the door, it doesn't look robust and doesn't match the colour and finish of the control panel trim so 4/5 for quality only because of this.
The display is ease to read and use although you do need to read the users instructions to understand all the symbols/programs when you first start using the machine. There seems to be a program for all possible laundry requirements,
the steam setting for refreshing the clothes really works well.
So an excellent machine would definitely recommend :)",Approved
"Overall very good product, spacious and grey color looks fantastic.
Though freeze make some weird noises, product manual states it is very normal. But still i am not used to it.",Approved
"Nearly sent it back as it struggled to dry, even on the maximum dryness setting. I had to read the manual and use a special menu to increase the drying settings to ++ maximum. Looks well built and the 5 year warranty is good, but as a dryer it is poor.",Approved
This AEG unit is ultra smart makes great coffee is easy to programme and basically does what it says on the tin. If I had a negative it would be that water container is a bit small but there is limited space available and we seem to be drinking much more coffee.,Approved
"An extremely well built machine, it feels solid, the panels don’t bend or flex when opening and closing the door like my old machine from another manufacturer. It has a great selection of programs, and all the ones I’ve used so far have given excellent results. The bed linen program does a really good job, bedding comes out soft, untangled, with very little creasing and not in a big damp ball like I was used to before. The wool cycle is also very good, keeping the clothes flat around the outside of the drum to make sure they don’t get damaged. The filters are all in one, so very easy to clean. The included drain kit means I have it plumbed in so no need to empty the container after each use. Overall delighted with this machine, and it has the added bonus of looking good too, which I don’t think I’d have ever said about a laundry appliance before!",Approved
I love the dryer. Bought it to match the washer that was purchased at the same time. Energy rating and drum capacity were also important. It looks great. Drying time takes longer and takes some getting used to but that’s fine. Highly recommended.,Approved
Really enjoy the features of this tumble dryer. Currently housed under the stairs but ultimately to be housed in an open plan kitchen you do not notice when the machine is on and I have no worries about it being too noisy when it's in a big open plan room. Only comment of negative is that the feature that auto stops drying when it sensed clothes are dry can be quick off of the mark and it stops when they are still a bit damp.,Approved
"Our AEG tumble dryer is reasonably quiet in operation, and goes un-noticed in ‘quiet’ mode. Drying times at first appear to be long according to the digital timer, although once the machine is working, the times are generally cut quite considerably due to inbuilt sensors. The drum rotates in one direction only, but our bed linen doesn’t appear to get tangled or knotted, but our children’s ‘tumble dry - no iron’ school uniform does come out very slightly wrinkled. Other than that, I am pleased with our purchase, and I would recommend this machine.",Approved

"Excellent washing machine. Only two gripes are that you cannot open door when timer is set as it locks on setting & not on starting & also the spinning speed is set to the programmes & cannot be changed manually so you only get a fast spin (1400) on one hotter programme not the most used one, 20 degree wash so clothes are not that dry when they come out. Find this very annoying especially when needing to get clothes dry inside on wet days.",Approved
"This product is excellent. Microwave function is fast and even, grill is speeedy and oven function is as good as my main oven. Easy to use and can set favourites for everyday use. Highly recommended",Approved
"The tumble drier was easy to install and has some good features. The door is large so gives easy access. The filter is easy to clean. There are plenty of programs and the machine is quiet. The machine dries well, some programs take a little longer than our last drier but the pay off is that it saves energy. Overall a good purchase.",Approved
Bought this fridge as a second one in my kitchen. It is very compact and just the right dimensions for the space I needed it to fit in. It is very quiet and I am very pleased with it. Would recommend,Approved
Very good tumble dryer - the single filter is very easy to clean and a great design much better than the older version dryers. Very large capacity and very easy to use,Approved
"This very smart looking neat oven has more features than my older larger oven!! The steam facility is great for making lovely moist cakes, and the temperature probe makes me confident about cooking whole chickens and joints of meat. It's very useful for when I am cooking smaller meals, using less fuel than my larger oven, but also comes into it's own when my family visit, giving me the extra capacity I needed in order to cook for the whole family. I am very pleased with it.",Approved
This is a great tumble dryer. The capacity is fantastic and makes drying larger loads seem easy. I also love the feature that restores the waterproofing of items of outerwear and to have a Woolmark accreditation is a real plus. And aside from all that the energy rating is brilliant.,Approved

There is plenty of space for everything you can think of (including 4 bottles of hobgoblin ale ! Don't bother replying to this saying real ale should be room temperature, I like it cold)

Anyway I digress. This is a top quality product and I would recommend it to anyone who has one of those fitted kitchens you can't swing a cat in. Also a good choice for landlords renting property. It's cheap and very reliable.",Approved
It’s quiet efficient in all aspects of what your require from a tumble dryer.,Approved
Very easy to use. Mind you we have only used 2 programs but it seems to wash well. Spins quietly and clothes come out pretty dry on 1200 spin. It seems to take longer than our old Hotpoint but part of that might be the cold fill only. So far - very pleased.,Approved
"So easy to use with the various selections - all are user friendly. Big door, takes a good load. Spin noise is so much better than my old machine - nearly makes washing a pleasure.",Approved
"This is the best tumble dryer I have ever used. I love the Woollens programme, in the past I always had to dry cashmere and merino knitwear on an airer as my previous dryer would have shrunk them. This dryer performs really well and also looks very stylish. Filter and water collection container are easy to remove and clean. I was also surprised at how quiet this dryer is in comparison to my old dryer. This dryer is quite expensive so I expect many years trouble free usage from it.",Approved
"I bought this machine based on its good capacity and drum size, quick wash feature and interior door handle (making it less likely to be pulled off by my curious toddler). It washes well and operates relatively quietly. However, it would be useful if it were possible to select temperatures other than 30 degrees for the quick wash (like on my previous machine), and to be able to manually select the spin cycle RPM - 1200 is great for getting excess water out of clothing but it's also like there's an earthquake rippling through my entire flat!",Approved
"I bought this as part of a new kitchen from John Lewis, to match a Zanussi oven. It is white, so fingers and greas are invisible! The gas is easy to control, but the control has to be held down for a few seconds as a safety measure.
Well recommended!",Rejected
This product has features which are easy to understand and use,Approved
"We were given this machine free of charge by AEG on the condition that we undertook an honest review after using it for a reasonable period. We already had an AEG washing machine of smaller load capacity, which we had had for nearly four years and with which we were very pleased.
The new L89499FL is a versatile machine with a larger capacity (9kg). It is capable of washing large items such as duvets and blankets. It is heavier than our previous AEG washing machine, although it has the same external dimensions and takes up no more space.
The new machine is exceptionally quiet, even with a 1400 rpm spin speed, and has a wide range of features that we have found very useful. The 1400 spin speed produces washing that is significantly drier than our previous 1200 spin speed. 
The machine has a wide range of programmes including a large choice of spin speeds. In particular, we have found the wool programme to be very gentle, allowing woollen items that we have previously washed by hand to be successfully washed without harm. Indeed the results suggest that the wool cycle is as gentle, if not more so, than hand washing. We held our breath when washing some very delicate woollen items, but our concerns were unwarranted. My wife has also washed a number of dresses, which were marked as hand wash only. By choosing a suitable programme, the machine has produced excellent results, with little or no need for ironing.
The machine includes a steam function that allows items to be refreshed that have only been worn once. It is claimed that this cycle removes creases, and reduces wear and tear on clothes by reducing the number of times that items need to be washed. Again we found these claims to be true. The cycle reduced creases and the amount of ironing needed. In many cases, ironing was not required at all.
The machine is very efficient in terms of energy, water use and time. The Opti sense system weighs the amount of washing and minimises the cycle time and water used, thereby avoiding over-washing. 
The control panel clearly indicates the amount of time remaining to complete a washing cycle. Moreover, there are a range of options allowing the user to select washing temperature, washing time, spins speeds etc..
The OKO mix system allows the detergent to be premixed with the washing water enabling a more even distribution of washing powder or liquid. A similar premix system applies to any softeners added. AEG claims that this produces a more efficient wash enabling a 30 degree wash to be as effective as a 40 degree wash. Although we cannot confirm this precisely, we have found the 30 degree washes to be effective and a higher temperature has been unnecessary. 
The only negative feature we have found is that the, albeit attractive, metal control panel, can reflect light so that the dial control cannot be easily read if strong light, such as sunlight is shining and reflecting off the surface. My wife has had to use glasses to set the dial, which was not necessary with the white painted control panel on our previous machine.
However, this is a minor matter, which we are already used to, and we have no hesitation in recommending this superb machine. It is clearly well made, and has an excellent range of useful features that result in efficient washing on a wide range of articles. This is by far the best washing machine we have used.",Approved

"My family and I were delighted that AEG selected us to receive a free washing machine in return for an honest review of its performance, which is what I will attempt to do.
Given how advanced this machine is, and knowing that a huge amount of the latest tech has gone into it, the design and operation of the machine is familiar, simple and clever. I was a little worried that you might need to be a computer programmer to operate it, but this was not the case, and regrettably I have no excuses not to use it!
We found that the machine works equally well on all settings and delivers a well balanced and thoroughly cleaned result.
A few features warrant special mention:
There are 4 compartments in the drawer, allowing you to put vanish or calgon into the machine and get it released at the right time. I have no idea how this ever worked in other machines, such a simple addition and so useful to help clean kids mud stained clothes.
The scales are also brilliantly simple but really useful, I now know how many T Shirts and socks I can safely stuff in before its a full load, especially helps with unbalanced loads as well.
My wife volunteered a very delicate hand wash only blouse which had sadly encountered some wine at a party and which she had written off as ruined. However, the combination of stain remover and gentle but thorough hand washing rescued the garment and it genuinely was 95% perfect after this. I can't say it was quite as perfect as TV ads would have us believe, but, certainly it rescued the top and returned it to near perfection.
Lastly, we love the eco wash, we use this for large heavy loads that can be left overnight, safe in the knowledge that not only will it be quiet, but it will cost next to nothing to get a perfect result, from what we could tell on our meter, perhaps a third of the cost of a standard wash, yes it takes longer, but, who cares!",Approved
"I love, love, love my new AEG dryer, it's brilliant at what it does, easy to clean, easy to choose programmes and it's quick too. Love the fact it does a reverse tumble to prevent clothes tangling, this may sound like a small detail but if you check out lots of other models, as I did, you will realise that very few of them add this. My one and only criticism would be I wish the door was hinged on the right of the machine and not the left. Would happily recommend this machine and to me it feels of good quality and sturdy too with the added bonus of being the best looking machine on the market!!",Approved

very good choice of features and easy to use. One comment would be that when using low loads the machine does make a lot of noise when spinning and vibrates.,Approved
We are updating our kitchen. My wife loves cooking so ours is a well used kitchen so the hood had to be functional. We saw this hood in a showroom and loved the design and it does a great job. We have an a.e.g cooker so we're confident of the quality.  Found it really easy to fit.,Approved
"What's to say, a quality product from a high reliability maker.",Approved
"On the whole I am very pleased with all the programs I have used so far. The steam function has been a real help to make ironing easier. My only criticism is the loud knocking sound. It is not the drum as the knocking sound continues when it is still, so may be the pump or motor.",Approved
Fully automatic drier that can be adjusted to most things that you might require. Seems to be well made. Water tank and fluff filter are both easy to empty.,Approved
"First impressions were this is a very nice looking machine - it certainly looks like what it cost! Performance so far has been great on mixed laundry. My only criticism would be our super king bedding doesn't come out 'cupboard dry' on this setting, as i think it's large size causes it to bunch up too much. Overall, happy. It's quieter than i thought.",Approved

"As a replacement for my Servis Quartz 1200 I was expecting washer technology to have advanced in 20 years. 
Not so. This washer takes 3 hours to do the same wash my Servis managed in under an hour with the same wash results. Even the quick wash is nearly 2 hours and don’t expect the ‘time remaining’ display to be of any use, it changes all the time. This means that all wash cycles are unnecessarily long. An example is the washer turning the drainage on and off when emptying the drum and long pauses between wash, rinse, spin. Why?
Also the washer fails even to turn the washing load over when on some lighter fabrics – clothes just sit at the bottom of the tub whilst the drum paddles brush against the clothes.
A poorly executed design and I wish there had been some owner reviews before I bought this awful product.
Don’t buy it.",Approved

"Sales man went through all the machines I was interested in, but AEG was a fantastic machine and a fantastic price, how could I refuse, and I can honestly say I couldn't be more pleased with this appliance. It washes really nice, and the timer is really accurate, my last machine showed I had a minute left before end of circle but carried on for 10mins very irritating. This also was a good brand, but I would now totally recommend AEG 100%.",Approved
"After researching online for a new dryer it turned out that a heat pump dryer was the way to go. Drying times don't seem as quick as a condenser dryer but the gains are that it uses less electricity & doesn't make the kitchen as hot as the new dryer uses less heat to dry the clothes. Also, as less heat is required you are not as worried as to what clothes you can dry as the heat used is a lot less than a condenser dryer. It also has a light which works very well.",Approved
Very good oven let down by having no timer function to pre set oven.,Approved
I love the internal light a great feature. The machine is also really quite which helps. I did think it was a bit expensive but I hope to get years of use to make it value for money. It is a smart looking machine.,Approved
best product ever...billy mays says so! You have to believe him right~!??!!,Approved
"This machine has a good range of programmes and the quick wash settings are very useful for small loads. But the noise level in spin mode is deafening,and it has taken a lot of effort to stop the machine walking about the kitchen.",Approved
Not all programmes have the short time cycle. So not at all as economical as I thought. This replaced my old machine which had a 30 minute cycle for all types of material and I wish I had paid for it to be repaired rather than replacing it. Cotton towels on a 40 degree wash is nearly 2 hours.,Approved
The clothes have to be reasonably wet before the sensors pick up the amount of water in the clothes. If you want to finish off the clothes it is best to use the timer.,Approved
"I like the design, it takes longer to dry but it doesn’t consume a lot. So a future purchase to think about.",Approved
Pot rack on top of the hob is uneven and dangerous when cooking. Smaller pots and pans keep falling off the hob and it's impossible for them to stand over the flame by themselves.,Approved
I have now used the product four or five times now and to date I am happy with the outcome. On the settings that I have used the items have been completely dry. Additionally the cleaning of the filter and emptying of the tank are simpler than my last tumble drier.,Approved
"I can't live without this machine! So useful and easy to use. Problem - an annoing sound appeared in the second month of use than the autorised technic couldn't resoleved yet, but i'm still glad of having this machine at home.",Approved
"Bought this new AEG machine to replace older model which broke down . Very satisfied with previous machine so chose another AEG product. Great looking machine with a 8kg load , ideal for a family of 4 . Has a good range of settings & programs to fit all your washing needs !",Approved
"Long programmes, no full load quick wash, automatic reductions in speeds with lower temperature washes, fairly noisy, all in all a great disappointment. We had to replace our Panasonic in a hurry. That had been excellent for 5/6 years and then had to be replaced due to a plastic cover on the drun shearing off and could not be replaced. That put us off having another one. It seemed such a silly thing to have to scrap the machine for.",Approved
This machine has a great drum and takes a lot of load. For my male fingers the controls are just too fiddly and I have more than once left the machine unstarted by accident. You need to press the start button twice to make it work which is annoying.,Approved
"This is an excellent machine in all ways except for 2 issues, one is it is noisy compared to previous machines we have had particularly on spin cycle. Secondly it is too easy to open the cover for the filter on the front panel.",Approved
This machine is a little noisier than I had hoped it would be but love the size of the drum and the programmes. disappointed that I have not yet received my £75.00 back which was the offer on at the time I bought the machine.,Approved
"The title says it all - quality of the wash, the noise levels are just two of the benefits",Approved
This washer dryer is good but the quick wash takes an hour and the spin speed button does not always work properly,Approved
I purchased this for a rental apartment and it has withstood constant use by 5 sharers and they have been extremely pleased with both the washing machine and the dryer facility!,Approved
"This product has great features, so thanks very much",Approved
"The quality and performance of this washing machine is far superior to my last one the controls are clear and very simple to use and the results are first class, I would recommend this product to anyone who is ready for a new machine",Approved
"This is a great tumble dryer, especially with the pre-programmed cycles which includes the ability to dry Wool items. I have to admit, I was nervous at first but this works perfectly. It also has a shirt programme which has made my life so much easier.

With the moisture sensors you have the ability to select the desired dryness level, which is perfect for towels etc. going into the airing cupboard.

Aesthetically, it is very pleasing and I love the light on the inside of the drum - this is only a small thing but what a difference.",Approved
This machine gives many options for drying different types of clothes. The best function has to be for work shirts which means minimal ironing required! It also looks great when stacked on top of the washing machine with the pull out shelf.,Approved
"After my last Zanussi of 14 years finally died needing a new motor, I thought it made more sense to buy a new one. It washed perfectly right to the end, always giving the cleanest results. This new Zanussi is just as impressive. The difference appears to be a few extra programs like duvet, jeans, quick 30mins and the extra spin speed on the cotton wash, which is noticeably quieter, the extra rinse choice and the extra drum size. The wash times are a little longer now on each program compared to my old Zanussi, that is no problem to me as I have found that the longer the wash the better the clean. Cotton wash at 60 was 4hrs long now 4hrs 15min. If you are the sort of person who likes to leave all their washing for one day then a Zanussi is not for you, but if like me and you wash the moment you have a one load which can average 1 to 2 loads per day and prefer the best clean rather than the fastest then Zanussi still provides the cleanest wash. Only one minor irritation for me, I use both powder detergent for whites and liquid for delicates and you now have to remove the draw, which is not easy, to drop a tab for liquids and raise for powder which wouldn’t be irritating if the drawer was easier to remove. Having tried and tested I find that the tab makes no difference to the wash so I just ignore it and leave the tab up for both powders and liquids. Also there appears to be no visible filter to check, I hope this means that the newer design no longer requires this feature.",Approved
"This is an excellent washing machine with just the right options for a normal family. It also has an ""eco"" function for small loads and short washes which is a necessary requirement.",Approved
very noisey on top spin/had two visits by egineers/new drum required and ordered/drum arrived with hole in /another drum ordered/ still waiting for repair/,Rejected
"Purchased this washing machine dryer to replace a Hotpoint.

Not only is it significantly quieter but the build quality is on a completely different level. Comes with 5 year warranty as a bonus!",Approved
"I had a Zanussi before which I had had for 13years so didn't hesitate buying another one. At first the powder didn't seem to be dissolving, I think that was my fault putting either too much poweder or washing in. Didnt think it was a quiet as when i first got my old one, but now I am used to it. Good price. Love the Quick cycle only 30mins.",Approved
very good reliable and straight forward operation of various settings had zanussi products previous for approx. 10 years still working just getting old so replaced.,Approved
"Have used the appliance for around a month now. After playing with all the settings we now get excellent results. Easy to use, very quiet and energy efficient.",Approved
"The machine produces an excellent array of different coffees, but the milk jug is fragile and has broken",Approved

"The product is well designed and made to withstand everyday use. The large dial on the front is clear and very easy to identify which program has been selected. The machine when in use is very quiet and can be used throughout the night without disturbing anyone. One of the biggest advantages of this machine is the wool program. My old machine which was also a AEG dryer did shrink some of my wool jumper's, so I was a little worried about drying woollen's in this machine. Nothing to worry about, all of my woollen's was dry and had not been shrunk. Excellent product as usual from AEG.",Approved
"I had a zanussi dish washer which was so great, so when I decided to change my washing machine, I decided to get a Zanussi washing machine.

The build is not very strong and has a very plastic feel to it.

The spin cycle is so noisy and the machine vibrates and shakes so hard it feels as if a plane is landing in the kitchen.

it's such a shame, as I was hoping that the Zanussi washing machine, would have a comparable quality to my Zanussi dishwasher.

It's not cheap either and I feel very let down by this purchase.

The controls are quite good and the features are very good too, but they surely missed a trick in not working to dampen the vibration.

I've bought all sorts of gadget to help dampen the vibration, but it's still not good enough.

Shame otherwise, a very good machine, but the noise and spin cycle lets it down very badly.

I'm starting to think it's faulty, but it seems that is the general gripe with this product .",Approved
The machine has a large capacity and option for reducing creasing. Quiet option is useful too.,Approved
We have had this washing machine for three weeks now. We have found that it is a top end washing machine. It has a lot of good functions on it,Approved

"The machine is very quiet and efficient but the programmes take forever, ipreferred the functionality of my previous AEG machine",Approved
"Zanussi is an excellent maker of all machines with very little to fault them but I found the instructions for this machine quite difficult to understand and I still have not figured out, even with following instructions closely, how to do certain things ie short cycle, short spin etc. Lights are not coming on as supposed to when I try various cycles and I would love someone to be standing beside me who knows how to do it.",Approved
"I am so disappointed in this product. I've even had an engineer out because I thought it was faulty. He told me it's the way the machine works and basically I have to put up with it taking 3 hours to dry a load. Also suggested putting less in my washing machine to work better with the weight limits on the cycles. Therefore a false economy. More washing means more energy and water being used. 
A waste of money. Can't believe I'm stuck with this dryer now as it's too late to send it back.",Approved
"Excellent, smart looking washing machine with lots of useful functions. Very good at washing even on a quick wash cycle (approx 1 hour long).
Only thing I would point out is that I tend to use the quick wash cycle on every wash I do (90 degrees down to 30 degrees) as the normal wash cycles are very long. A standard 40 degree wash without using quick wash can take close to 3 hours. I don't really understand why any clothes need to be washed for that long?! That would be my only negative thing to state but my clothes wash very well on quick cycle compared to other machines I have owned previous :)",Approved
"Really pleased with our new AEG tumble dryer. It was easy to install, works like a dream and is really quiet. We bought it because other people reviewed it well and having a free 5 year warranty it is obvious AEG believes in the quality of their product!!",Approved
"I don't no much about any features on this beast, but my wife said that it is simply the best. Perfect for pets owners, no hair after drying. All so super quiet. So it does what it should do. Best regards from my wife.",Approved

"I'm really pleased with my OKOKombi washer dryer. The wash programs all clean really well, especially the synthetics one (my boys' rugby kit has never been so clean!) I also actually bothered to read the instructions this time and had a go at the steam settings. Now all my jackets have been steam cleaned and they're as good as if I'd sent them to the dry cleaners.

I particularly like the extra short wash and the eco settings. I don't really use the dryer part but when I have, it's been as good as any other tumble dryer I've had. And the high spin speed means the clothes need less drying anyway.

The only negative is that the on/off button isn't as responsive as I'd expect - you have to press it a couple of times to get it to work.",Approved
Having used this dryer now for quite a few weeks it has its forbals. The bed linen cycle leaves the sheets duvet covers much too wet and even after ironing them I have to hang them for two days in our utility room to make sure they are aired enough before I store them away. Noise level is good easy to empty water container and lint filter. Not as good as my 18 year old vented machine I left in my old house. Looks good with my aeg washing machine that I have had now for 11 years slightly disappointed in my choice ceases bedlinen also takes a lot of steam ironing to get creases out,Approved

I initially thought that the T8DSC869C was a very good machine in all aspects. A fully automatic machine that could be manually changed to most requirements. I also thought that it was very well made. However I have found that it does have at least one flaw in its design. Within a few weeks the draw front broke away from the powder draw. The front is attached to the draw with 3 very flimsy plastic bars. This is a design area that needs a serious look at. I do have the 5 year warranty but have to hope that if I am very carefull it might not break again. I did receive a replacement in about a week.,Approved

This fridge freezer packed up after 14 months. 6 technician visits and they still can't fix it. Gross inconvenience staying in for each appointment which takes days. Definitely would not recommend.,Rejected
"After fitting the washer and making sure it was level, it vibrated and moved dramatically. We were fobbed off by the retailer Currys so went direct to Zanussi. The inspector came to have a look and told us there was something wrong with the floor which was funny as we never had a problem with the old washer. After much disputing Zanussi sent some feet to put on the washer which has reduced the vibrating significantly. Not a nice experience but Zanussi dealt with the problem in a better manner than the retailer did.",Rejected
"The machine is very efficient, the delay start feature delays longer than it states, but that is no problem, just means that you have to remember to delay only for 6 hours if you want an overnight wash. (6 hr delay was almost 8 hr). My verdict, good value for money, fairly quiet in operation, even with fast spin! there are some features we have'nt tried yet, but will do soon.",Approved
it is clean efficient and cheap to run so easy to empty,Approved
"What a fantastic machine, this is such a great help - powerful & efficient and easy to use - the touch buttons are sensitive and easy to get use too. The machine does not get too hot so is very safe. 
The load capability is incredible.
Highly recommend",Approved
"Fridge freezer appears to work well. The freezer is a bit on the small size, and I have low expectations on the durability of the clear plastic shelves, drawers etc - they are made of very thin plastic.",Approved

"Great tumble dryer. I use it for drying pretty much everything including waterproof clothing.
Only gripe is that I feel the need to extra-dry everything before putting it away (which isn't the end of the world and only means it's drying for an extra few minutes) as the 'cupboard dry' setting leaves laundry still a bit too damp for me preference.",Approved
Like the size of fridge and freezer has 3 deep draws to fit a good amount of food in. Also it uses less electricity than my old one.,Approved

Far too noisy and sounds very ""tinny"". Programme choice is not as good either and most programmes are far too long. Just sounds very cheap and tinny. I have always chosen zanussi because they were quiet. Not any more!",Approved
"I have recently come to own this machine, and feel that I needed to have gone to Uni to operate it!!!

As previous reviews find the lack of information as to which stage in the wash cycle the clothes are, forever referring to the small instruction booklet, my first wash (light weight coloureds) took nearly 3 hours, I kept going into the utility room to check it was still working. now 2 weeks in and only find I'm using two wash cycles, then as clothes still quite wet have to put onto spin cycle. Seemed good buy at first, but my Ariston of 13 years was a lot better :-(",Approved

We bought AEG because it’s brand name was synonymous with quality. The features on the machine with its many sub options are simple to select and understand.

"Don't waste your time and money on this one. The touch sensitive panel is the main problem. It puts itself into ""Pause"" mode by no reason, I have to go and check the dryer often, to make sure it is still spinning. For the top end expensive machine, it should not be like this.

My first one has the fault on the first use, JohnLewis replaced it with a new one immediately. The 2nd one works for a while, every now and then the problem will come back again.

This is a utterly rubbish machine, AEG should refund my money and I will go to buy a BOSCH instead! I have never bought any product makes me angry so much!",Rejected

"This was our first AEG purchase, and so far we've been extremely impressed with the T97689IH3.

It has an A+++ energy rating, which is good for energy consumption, an 8 kg capacity which is perfect for our family and it has a range of versatile programs for specific fabric care.

I would definitely recommend this product, as the ProTex Plus system enables you to dry your laundry with great results!",Approved
Very solid product. Been using it for 2 years and works like a charm. Would like to be able to clear the small particle filter in the tube. Also would love to have the Start stop in the handle on all models not only the top model.,Approved
"Married for over 30 years in same house and being the delegated 'vacuumer' for most of that time - Iv'e never been happy since we (i) retired the 'Hoover Constellation' my mum gave me on leaving home in 1978. Since that time 'I' have had at least 4 other vacuum's from well know manufacturers and none of them could get anywhere near the original 'floating wonder' of that 60s icon - Until now - The AEG Ultra Captic is simply wonderful. Strong (in all departments) Its well built, its quiet and has great 'inovative' tools and - oh yes - it vacuum's vey well also. It also has a long lead and hose. Altogether for me (I do not have a pet -- so cant comment there) the best ever. The down side is - my wife is threatening to start using it - Now come on - now way after 30 years of searching for that perfect vacuum am I going to give up now! Well done AEG.",Approved
"1. They don’t actually work... on dog hair!

I'm a dog owner and that’s not going to change. The dog lives in the house like the rest of us and so the floors, rugs, furniture, cushions and curtains get a bit hairy at times. Several manufacturers have brought to the market ‘pet’ or ‘animal’ vacuum cleaners, but so far I have been terribly disappointed.

If you are a pet owner like me, you probably learnt that neutrally coloured shaggy rugs are the way to go to hide the hair! But of course you still want to keep it clean. Shaggy rugs are not always easy to vacuum, so we have been shaking and bashing and beating, followed by vacuuming, regularly. I felt confident that I was getting this right. But when the AEG UltraCaptic arrived, I tried it on a - what I thought - clean shaggy rug first to see how it copes with this sort of surface. And I was SHOCKED by the amount of GUNK that came out of it! Eek! Clearly this machine sucks in a good way where other before just sucked in a bad way.

I decided to put the AEG UltraCaptic through the ultimate test for suction and dealing with dog hair. I found something which I didn’t expect to ever get clean again - not even using a very powerful vacuum cleaner: An old dog blanket that hasn’t been cleaned in a month and has dog hair ALL OVER, and is of a particular weave which causes the hair to really stick. I laid this on a soft surface and used the upholstery tool on the two lower power settings to vacuum in three directions. To my amazement, I managed to remove ALL hairs in the test spot! I kid you not! I have never seen a vacuum cleaner work this well; I have not even dreamt of it!

2. They are big and heavy and difficult to manoeuvre for the average woman.

Ok, so we all agree now that vacuuming the house counts as a workout. Fine. But it doesn’t need to be torture! Exercise is not supposed to hurt - or worse, injure - you. It’s quite unbelievable how we just take the pain! Small, lightweight vacuum cleaners tend to be less powerful, so we have to go with the full-size models for a decent job. But they are heavy to lift and carry up and down the stairs, the tubes get heavier and heavier as you work, and the to-and-fro action can literally lead to an RSI - especially in the wrists.

At just over 10kg the AEG UltraCaptic isn’t exactly feather-lite, but it comes with a decent handle that allows for easy lifting and carrying. Even holding it while dusting the stairs wasn’t all that bad. The fact that the body is pretty compact and nicely rounded also makes things easier. Large, soft wheels supported by a soft ball wheel in the belly makes the machine glide about nicely.

The tube is pretty light, and fitted with an ergonomic handle which I found to be substantially easier on my sensitive wrists.

3. They make a big noise which adds to the stress of cleaning day, for everyone in the house.

High power means big noise, right? Not anymore! The AEG UltraCaptic is surprisingly quiet - even at full power. This is aided by the AeroPro Silent Nozzles and tube that were designed with both efficiency and noise reduction in mind.

If you are still weary of disturbing the baby - or the grumpy husband - just use a lower power setting. It really whispers on 1 and 2, and trust me, it will still clean well - probably better than your old vacuum cleaner!

The body also pads around the room quietly thanks to soft wheels and ‘bumpers’.

Ah, that is so much better now that my ears don’t hurt.

4. Telescopic tubes fly back and bite your hand! Or push-together tubes come apart while working.

Now I am sure you have experienced tubes coming apart while you’re working or moving your vacuum cleaner. It is super annoying! Some manufacturers ‘fixed’ this problem with telescoping tubes. Great! But how many of you have been pinched - or worse, bitten that you bleed - in the hands by these telescopic tubes suddenly flying back?! This has made me sooooo angry!

The AEG UltraCaptic comes with perhaps a slightly longer than usual (when compacted) telescopic tube, but somehow more compact, with less ‘clunk’ surrounding it. The telescopic mechanism is snug and there is absolutely no chance of it slipping. What a relief!

In fact, everything clicks together nicely and and snugly - a sign of engineering perfection and quality workmanship. Very reassuring.

5. Vacuuming makes me - and others in the house - sneeze.

Most of us are allergic to house dust to some extent. With time, vacuum cleaners get clogged up with microscopic dust particles that eventually find their way back into the atmosphere and this is when we wish we never disturbed them in the first place!

The AEG UltraCaptic features a clever filtering system: A main filter as usual, with a fine dust collector, followed by an industrial-strength HEPA 13 filter to capture the last few microscopic particles. What is that? HEPA = High-Efficiency Particulate Air, with 13 being quite a serious rating, meaning at least 99.95% of all particles up to the size of 0.3 micrometers (that is 0.0003 mm) are captured!

Both filters can be washed and I note that AEG advises replacing the filters every 2 years - again a statement indicating a long projected lifespan, which is also demonstrated in the 5 year guarantee that comes with the product.

Anyway, I was telling you about the filtering system... So far it sure has made a difference to my nose!

6. The cord is so short you need to move plugs all the time.

The AEG UltraCaptic comes with a SEVEN METER cord! Need I say more? Well, yes, I would like to add that the auto-rewind works like a dream - fast and smooth, retracting all the way. Up and down the stairs I go... Love it!

7. Suction usually is too strong to clean soft things around the house, like cushions and curtains.

I am a creative - and lazy - person. I have tried to clean various unorthodox things with my vacuum cleaner. And why not? Unfortunately, even the most pathetic vacuum cleaners will ‘eat’ things like curtains and get stuck on light cushions.

At first I thought the variable power settings (select from 1 to 5) on the AEG UltraCaptic must be a gimmick, but I immediately realised that this was the answer to my problem! I can now clean the curtains and cushions, and even dust around trinkets on shelves (YES!) thanks to lower power settings.

8. Emptying is a nightmare and gets my hair dirty.

First we had bags. Changing them was a messy affair, but at least the dust was bagged to a fashion. But we got bored with having to look for replacement bags, so the manufacturers all went with bagless cylinders. We thought it was a fantastic idea, but now we all dread that moment when we have to empty the vacuum cleaner, because it takes a lot of shaking, tapping, and even bashing, poking and scraping, to get the dust out of the container and into the dustbin. The hubby insists on emptying into the kitchen dustbin, which drives me mad, because as you know a substantial percentage of the dust just goes back into the atmosphere! I have been taking the thing to the outside bin to give it a proper clean-out, but then I end up so dirty I need a thorough shower and have to wash my hair. I HATE IT! And I’m sure you do to.

Enters the AEG UltraCaptic with its ‘Compact & Go’ concept dust container. When the dust reaches the maximum line, just pull a lever to quickly compact it and make space for a bit more. Then when you’re ready, compact again before lifting the container, by the same lever which is also a handle, from the machine. Holding the dust container over a bin, simply push a button to make the bottom swing open and release the compacted lump of dust gently into the bin. There’s no dust cloud, because the fine dust has already been filtered out, and the rest has been compacted to make it less ‘flitty’. Also, because the dust has been compacted, it won’t stick to the sides of the dust container - which are flat and smooth, unlike some other stupid gadgety makes I have encountered. How cool is that compactor and swing-open bottom!

9. I can’t remember where the filters are and can’t be asked to ‘go there’.

So you know it’s important to maintain machines, and in the case of vacuum cleaners this means cleaning and/or changing filters. But they’re always hidden somewhere inside and you need to remove a succession of parts that makes you worry that you’ll never get the thing put back together again...

I’ve already introduced the AEG UltraCaptic’s filtering system in point 5 above. But I haven’t told you how accessible they are, and how easy to maintain.

On the ‘belly’ of the machine, push two buttons together to make the fine dust container swing open. The fine dust container needs emptying out only every 6 months, and really is no hassle. It just takes a gentle tap, and then you can rinse away what is left under a cold-water tap. The main filter located in the dust container can also be washed. The manual advises doing this every 6 months, and replacing the filter every 2 years.

Similarly, push two buttons together at the rear of the machine for the lid to the HEPA filter to swing open. The HEPA filter can also be washed under a tap every 6 months and should be replaced every 2 years.

So it can’t be easier to look after your vacuum cleaner. Totally idiot proof!

10. They are clumsy things to store away and take up a lot of space.

So you don’t have the luxury of a dedicated room for these things, and even though the AEG UltraCaptic is a good looker, it’s not exactly an ornament you want to put on display!

The AEG UltraCaptic has ‘parking slots’ on both the side and the back of the machine, so you can store it either lying flat (e.g. behind a sofa) or standing upright (e.g. in the back of a cupboard). An accessory clip is provided for attaching perhaps the 3-in-1 nozzle to the pipe. I use a jute bag to keep all the other accessories together. Really stows away neatly.",Approved
"I didn't think a washing machine could be so futuristic but this appliance is an incredible piece of engineering. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing and because of its design wouldn't look out of place in any nice kitchen, but it has all the features i need and more, even things i'd never thought of. As for my clothes, they are less creased, they feel softer and although not everybody is that interested in energy efficiency - it means a lot to me and this is great as its A+++.",Approved
"I choose Zanussi as my previous experiences with this brand have been good.

My washing comes out looking good even on the short programme . This washer has a good size drum which is great for bedding & towels I don't like to pack a washer too full as I like my clothes to get plenty of water round them which I feel they do with this washer . Very pleased with my purchase . Thank you .",Approved
"This washer-dryer does a good job. It's efficient and there is a good choice of selection buttons which are labelled and therefore clear and easy to use. There's a quick wash button which is really useful and I am sure the tumble-drying is faster drying than our last machine (not Zanussi).
For a reasonably priced and reliable machine, I have no hesitation in recommending this product.",Approved

"The versatility of this hoover allows for a multitude of surfaces to be hoovered with little challenge to the level of suction offered.

The first impression of the look of the hoover was that i thought it looked like a transformer and it certainly lives up to my first impression. If you are undecided as to whether to buy an upright or a cylinder then this is the cleaner for you. The various attachments transform the hoover. One of the attachments (my favorite) has a spinning brush which evolves the hoover from a cylinder to an upright.

The compact and go function is a definite plus point of this cleaner. It compacts the waste collected- reducing the need for regular emptying. You compact the waste, removes the dust bin, and empty.

The digital display adds to the sleekness of the cleaner and the colour and ergonomic design makes an attractive addition to the household.

The hoover emits a minimal level of noise which is significantly reduced when you use the AeroPro Silent nozzle, particularly useful when you feel the urge to hoover when the children are asleep!

The cleaner, by far, is a leading competitor and would rival vacuum cleaner with a much higher value in price. Affordable, sleek, lightweight and revolutionary are but a few words to describe this cleaner. An absolute must to any body's household.",Approved

"I had never been a fan of coffee machines but stayed in a hotel in London as a birthday treat by my wife.
We had an AEG machine in our room so I gave it a whirl and wow my dislike for pod machines went out the window. So much so I ordered one while at the hotel to be delivered when i got home. I love Lavazza coffee it's far better than the popular makes ( You know who they are ) so for me it's a perfect match AEG and Lavazza.
All I can say is buy one you won't regret it !!!",Approved
"I have been using this stylish vacuum cleaner for a month now and I have been bowled over with both it's functionality and its style.

The 5 power setting mean that the suction is brilliant which ensures that both my carpets and wooden floors are clean with the minimum of effort whilst the fab `compact and go' feature allows me to clean the entire house twice over before having to empty the cylinder which saves so much time.

This cylinder vacuum cleaner is perfect for busy households like ours!",Approved
"I have had two of these vacuum cleaners in a year. The first failed to start after six months as the on/off switch broke. As AEG/Electrolux do not have a service engineer in my area, I was given a replacement machine. Great I thought, but sadly the replacement machine has failed to start after six months usage. Again, with the the same problem...a broken on/off switch.

Otherwise the machine works really well, just don't expect it to last longer than six months.",Approved
"Very satisfied with this washing machine, easy to use whichever programme you require. Like the beep when the programme has finished. Highly recommend this product.",Approved
This washing machine has exceeded all my expectations the large 9kg drum copes with the largest of loads without loss of performance. The salt dispensing compartment means that you use less detergent to achieve excellent results at all temperatures which is ultimately better for both the environment and your clothes. The anti allergy program is great for people who suffer from dust allergies or wh o have eczema. I have already recommended this product to my family and friends.,Approved

"I wasn't sure about buying a cylinder vacuum but love this one. It has easy to use controls on the hose handle with 5 speeds. It picks up really effectively and is easy to use. It is beautifully designed, with a long flex which stores inside the vacuum with press of a button. The bags have large capacity with a cardboard lid that slips into place when you remove the full bag to avoid spills. My only complaint is that it can be very noisy at the highest speed.",Approved
"The AEG UltraCaptic promises powerful multi cyclonic suction and easier emptying and that is exactly what you get. There is a clear LED display to show which one of the five power levels is being used, with a small lever to increase or decrease the suction as needed. The suction, even on low power was incredible.

It comes with a telescopic handle, making light work of hard to reach places, and three different nozzles: the AeroPro Silent nozzle, which really does reduce noise levels, a Turbo nozzle making pet hairs easy to pick up, and a Parketto nozzle which is great for hard floors. There is also a brilliantly designed 3-in-1 tool featuring a brush, crevice nozzle and an upholstery nozzle all in one little tool. The AeroPro Silent nozzle has side brushes which clean right up to the skirting boards, reducing the need to use the crevice nozzle and, more importantly, reducing my cleaning time.

The AeroPro Ergo handle made it very easy to handle and I was able to push it around with a lot less effort than an ordinary vacuum cleaner.

It is very easy to maneuver and glides around on its soft wheels. You can also store it vertically or horizontally as there are parking clips on the side and back of the cleaner.

The HEPA 13allergy filtration makes it great for anyone suffering from an allergy and this filter is removable and washable.

The biggest feature on the UltraCaptic is the 'Compact and Go' system. This allows you to compact the dust which firstly, allows you to carry on cleaning for longer, and secondly, allows you to empty the canister without the usual accompanying clouds of dust that you normally get with a bagless machine. It is so easy to use that I was able to do it with one hand (very important when you need the other hand to deal with three young children). It was simple to remove, empty and fit back together. Something I've never experienced with a bagless cleaner before.

Overall, I am very impressed with the UltraCaptic. It is extremely powerful, is easy to empty and is a good looking machine. It allows me to switch quickly and easily between different floor types, and has shaved precious minutes off the time I would normally spend doing the vacuum cleaning. Its ergonomic design and powerful suction make it a pleasure to use.",Approved
"I have 6 cats, 3 are black and their fur lies on top of my Chinese rugs like balls of fluff. Previous cleaners have driven me mad as I eventually have to get down on hands and knees to painstakingly brush the rugs. Not this one, it is amazing. The suction leaves no cat hairs anywhere. It has saved me so much time as I was beginning to hate trying to keep my carpets clean. Highly, highly recommended.",Approved
"This coffee machine the AEG Favola Plus / Lavazza Modo Mio is easy to install, with automatic programs and at a touch of a button within minutes you can be drinking the great coffees of Lavazza. The steamer also is very simple to use providing good froth and hot milk in a very short time. A great machine by AEG to be highly recommended to compliment the superb coffee of Lavazza.",Approved
"I am one of an owner of Ultraone 8870C, I dont know where to start to explain my complains.
MOTORISED HEAD IS TOO HEAVY TO USE ON WHOLE TYPE OF FLOOR AND USE IN SMALL AREAS: VERY VERY BAD.
1. Your product is very useless. I am also an owner of Rainbow, and i know how to use motorised turbo cleaner Your product is so pure with its very heavy and hulky head. Its brush is so soft to open the tile of the carpet. I am so curious about it touches to the carpet, too. 50V. So less power. I DONT KNOW IT REALLY CLEANS MY HOME. I HAVE GREAT SUSPICION about whole parts.
2. You give two useless cleaning head in addition to the motorised head. These small parts can not be used with vacuum cleaner's circular handle. Cause, it is too long to manage the meneouvre ability of these small accessoirises.
3. You have no any other head to clean parkets and you are waiting for us to use the heavy metalic motorised head on the parket. Wooouw what a risk! Why didint you think about parket, you may have added any parket brush. But not.
4. I AM LOOKING FOR THE SPARE PARTS OF THIS CLEANER IN TURKEY BUT NONE OF SERVICE PERSONEL EXCEPT GENERAL ADMINISTRATION OFFICE WORKERS KNOWS WHICH PARTS ARE SUITABLE FOR MY VACUUM CLEANER.

I NEVER SUGGEST ANY OF YOUR PRODUCT, CAUSE I UNDERSTOOD, YOU ARE NOT TESTING YOUR CLEANERS VERY WELL IN HOME ENVIRONMENT. AND AGAIN YOUR ULTRAONE SERIES IS SO UNSUCCEEDED. IF I HAD CHANCE I COULD GIVE IT BACK AND GET MY MONEY. SO SORRY ABOUT AEG QUALITY.

"Usually I not writing reviews, but I couldn't this time.I'm using cleaner now for 2 month. To compare with car it's like monster truck with silent exhaust.
1. very silent, it's so silent that I can hear neighbor TV behind wall
2. Picks up hair at first pass with power brush, no need to mention other dust.
3. Auto function works very well, I using it all the time except on rags.
4. Even it bagged cleaner, but it last very long time. I hoovering now for 2 months regularly and it still more to go.
5. No looses suction, just use genuine bags
6. Dust free cleaner. I owned many bagless cleaner and after emptying them I would rather go to wash myself as I usually covered with dust (not very healthy thing)
7. Power brush its monster, picks up all hair at first pass and there is LEDs in front I find very useful especially if I cleaning early morning or late.
8. Has compact 3 in 1 nozzle, also a lot of end connections for every surface.
9. Looks beautiful
10. Remote control, no more need lay down or go back to cleaner to adjust suction power, no need power on off, all done with remote, very very usefull
10. I can say it does what it say it do, it's true AAAA cleaner.
and finally every time I need to vacuum I looking forward as it pleasant in any way.
If you have money, or if you don't save on it as it high quality and performance all around.",Approved

"Overall satisfied with the cleaners performance, it cleans the floors very well and is quiet, however very disappointed with the small attachments. The nozzle is far too short and consequently is not always fit for purpose. There is far too much waste with this product. We have left two floor cleaning options in the box as they are unnecessary. Sadly a waste for us and I guess for most. Money would have been better invested with a better range of small attachments.

Have been looking for a vacuum cleaner that is very quiet for use in noise sensitive areas and found your product and it has been outstanding and fits the bill just what we needed,Approved
Works well and is easy to use. It was bought to replace a more expensive product that became unuseable and seems to be a better and more user friendly unit.,Approved
Very happy with the purchase. I wanted an affordable silent vacuum cleaner. This is the best one I found with the noise level acceptable for me.,Approved
"it is quite loud and as I said above, a light bulb has gone already after about 8 uses.",Approved
"I have been extremely pleased with my purchase. The machine has been an absolute pleasure to use - who knew there could be so much pleasure associated with a washer/dryer! ?

All the hints and tips did not appear to be in any specific order. However, I have to commend Louise at your Sheffield centre for her excellent customer service and advice.",Approved
"The problem I have experienced is the water container “seating” it is not adequate.. poorly designed.
The water container does not “lock” into position easily result is that it can leak.This leaves surface covered in water. In my case the water destroyed £60 of vouchers. I was not pleased
Apart from that it is a good product and I enjoy the coffee.",Approved
I love this washing machine. I've never had an AEG before so was a bit apprehensive. However it has surpassed all my expectations and I would definitely recommend it,Approved

Great looking coffee machine. Nice features. And the coffee it produces is brilliant. But the build quality lets it down. From the 1st moment i started using it. The machine leaked water. And it leaked from the bottom by the electric socket. I wasnt impressed with the technical helpline either. As they said because i brought it from a particular store i had to take it back there as they had there own repair centre. Dont put the AEG technical support number on the machine then if you cant use it!!!!!!,Rejected

"The Lavazza a modo mio coffee machine is a sleek, well designed piece of equipment. The pods result in no mess and produce great coffee whilst the milk steamer is fantastic for lattes and cappuccinos. Would highly recommend to all coffee lovers. Also looks fantastic ad modern in kitchen.",Approved
"I'm not a fan of the ergonomics of this vacuum. The wand feels cheap and plasticky to me. It's also a bit thick and awkward for my hand to maneuver comfortably. Having said that, it has excellent suction and after all, that is why I purchased it. The cord is long which is always a plus. This vacuum replaced a Miele which may explain some of my dissatisfaction. That vacuum lasted over 15 years and probably only died because my contractor used it to vacuum plaster dust.",Approved
"It’s fine apart from heads, not thin enough to get into smaller placed",Approved
"We just bought an identical replacement after last than 18 months. The original machine made great coffee, but started overheating, so both coffee and milk tasted terrible.

NICE NEAT FRIDGE LOTS OFF ROOM INSIDE VERY PLEASED,Approved
"Has made my windows look like new which is fantastic. Really simple to just wipe with soapy water and then vacuum it off. It got rid of the dog nose marks perfectly. Works in the car too but using the large scraper makes it a bit tricky. Would definitely recommend this product though. The good points outweigh the bad, as once you know what you're doing it's great. Design is good but could do with smaller attachment as standard.

Instructions are almost useless so I just used my own intuition to put it together but I did get it wrong at first and filled it with water to the max line then realised that it should be empty and it was vacuuming up the water from the window. I think the instructions show the wash bottle (that you don't get) instead of the device bottle. Once I figured this out it worked like a dream. Shame it didn't come with the wash bottle and the smaller scraper particularly for the price but it did work well with just wiping the window with soapy water. I wasn't sure of the best way to use it and getting into some corners was tricky. But all in all it was very good and the bad points are minor",Approved
"I use this product to dry the walls, shower glass after having a shower. It dries the walls very well but the water container fills up very quickly so has to be emptied after I have dried a couple of walls. It would also be good if the rubber strip could be secured into place as it does tend to start slipping out. You also have to make sure that you clean any rubbish (hair etc) out of the little holes that the water comes out of when you empty it - otherwise it is difficult to empty the water - again this could possibly be improved. 1st version failed to charge after about 3 months, but the new one is currently fine.",Approved
Excellent purchase. Very easy to use. Something I’ve wanted for ages and doesn’t disappoint,Approved
I received this as a free gift. It's not something i would have considered buying before but now appreciate just how useful they are. Great for cleaning windows but also for drying tiles after showers and baths. So much easier and more effective than cloths or squeegees.,Approved
"This unit is nice quality but fails miserably on power and suction. Not much use and will probably never use it, think i'll give it away...",Approved
"has every feature you need, easy to use plus all the build quality you'd expect from the AEG people, has been used every day since purchase.",Approved
This window cleaner is so easy to use and last for ages on a single charge. Makes the usual window cleaning chore almost a pleasure.,Approved
"Its of good quality,lots of space,self defrosts what more do you need.",Approved
"Thought it was great until I heard strange noises from the bathroom. When I investigated, the window vac was switching itself on and off, so I put it on charge but it kept doing it. At a loss, I unplugged it and left it for a couple of days, then tried again to charge it and this time it took the charge and started working again. Just have to hope this was a hiccup! No response from supplier......",Approved
"I chose this extractor as I wanted a hood that was unseen and didn't spoil the lines of a contemporary kitchen even when in use, avoiding chimney extractors being the key.
Second was the extraction rate which is just superb!!",Approved
"We were surprised by the amount of space in the fridge, not only in the shelves in the body of the fridge but also in the door shelves.

We can strongly recommend it.",Approved
Side mounted buttons and serial number label are difficult to reach when the cooker hood is mounted between two wall cupboards.,Approved
"Beautiful coffee machine, great milk frothing jug do the work. Lovely thick crema, and good taste. Doesn’t take up lots of space and easy to assemble.",Approved
Difficult to establish correct carbon filters. Needed to refer to Customer Services. Very awkward to fit - not enough room to see what I was doing. Be patient and keep trying.,Approved
"Waiting to have door fixed under warranty
Not level at top or side",Approved
"The extractor looks great in our kitchen and is very effective at removing any steam/smoke from our hob. There are no drips of condensation that run off the extractor which was a previous problem when we had a glass surround on our extractor. This is great if you cook steak a lot as well - no more smoke detectors going off! 

Its also easy to clean off any smudges with a small amount of linseed oil.",Approved
Excellent product... i would definitely recommend this product and great service...,Approved
"A well made coffee maker, not the cheapest around but you get what you pay for. We have recommended this product to many people who have tasted the various products that it can produce. The cleaning is not as finicky as I was imagining - just a couple of minutes. The descaler is quite an expensive item to buy - at around £25 it is necessary to keep it working. Overall I think it is a great coffee maker and I am very pleased.",Approved
The only change I would make to this is an oven door that slides in underneath and a far more adjustable grill. It seems the grill is either on or off,Approved
"The small oven/grill, when used as an oven, keeps going out. You have to hold the ignition button down for a long while but even after it has finally come on, it goes out at some point. I've called out an engineer. He said it was a common problem but he hadn't got a part, which might help, on his van. I'm waiting for a return visit. Meanwhile, the small oven isn't usable.
There is, also, a major design fault with the grill/oven. The grill pan and the oven shelf won't fit in the compartment at the same time, even when it is turned off. Engineer confirmed this. I wish I'd bought a cheaper cooker.",Approved
This just compliments the rest of my AEG appliances and it is very effective too.,Approved
"This is a great extractor, modern looking, works very well, and runs quietly. Especially good for tall cooks, like me, who are forever banging their heads on the canopy type of extractors. My only criticism is the light bulbs are difficult to replace and the bulbs themselves are hard to find, even on line.",Approved
"I am sorry to say it is a very bad build quality and poor design for the operating buttons. It would have been good to have individual separate buttons to operate and regulate the speed. We are waiting for over 2 weeks for a repair to be completed on a second engineer visit due to the poor quality material used. The buttons after a while get sticky in between and impossible to clean due to the poor design and the housing assembly which keeps the buttons in place behind, stay exposed under heat due to the normal cooking hence ended up deforming and broke. this caused the whole buttons unit to dislocate from their normal position. And since the buttons get sticky they get harder to push and if you push one button the next button gets pushed with it due to the stickiness in between. The filters are very fragile and very poor build quality. I would have expected a much more better quality.",Approved
"We spend lots of time in Spain where you never get a poor cup of coffee in any restaurant, cafe or coffee bar. But the opposite in the U.K, bitter weak wishy washy seems to be the normal offering especially in some of the big name coffee chains. We owned nine coffee makers, different makes and means of production but none has given the cup we were looking for. Until now. The coffee we are now able to produce is perfect every time, and able to reproduce it consistently is wonderful. The Lavazza coffee maker is excellent in every way, easy to use, short delivery time when you are in a rush, consistent in quality, easy to clean and very well made. Our Best Buy for some time. My garage is now home to nine redundant coffee makers, my Lavazza takes pride of place in the kitchen. Thank you for making coffee drinking such a simple pleasure.",Approved
Well made looks good but really very noisy even on 1st setting,Approved
"The cooker hood was installed within a brand new kitchen in 2013. It is beautiful - so stylish and when working, extremely effective.
However, after 4 years it stoppedworking, by fusing the main fuse board. Two electricians checked the wiring...all OK. The AEG recommended repairer came out and said they didnt know what was wrong, but they tried to order three new main replacement parts, 1. a control panel, 2.an electronic module and 3. a capacitor. No.3 is now obsolete and therefore not available - not though AEG or any of the online spares shops. The repairers came out again and fitted the two parts they had got, but the same thing happened. Everything fused at the box. 
The AEG/Domestic&General repairers cancelled the repair contract.
So now I have this huge hood that has to be scrapped because I cant get the spare part.  It still looks beautiful and has been carefully treated, but is totally useless.
I will never buy AEG again
Replacing with another make/model will be expensive, because it is cut into the tiles in my new kitchen, so the whole area will have to be re-tiled around the replacement hood.
Why is the part obsolete? Why arent they made anymore? All other manufacturers produce spare parts......
I am very upset.",Rejected
"Fantastic performance, both ovens have very large capacity and perform fast with great cooking resolts.
The 4 gas burners are great and perform outstandingly",Approved
Nothing bad to say here design and the use of the product are great happy with this purchase so far,Approved
Easy to operate with simple design. Extracts smells and steam very well. The strengths of the light could be a bit biger but it's just mine personal preference.,Approved
"On paper this was one of the quietist cooker hood, and it is very quiet using the carbon filter to recirculate the air but costly to replace the filter. It would have been useful to know beforehand that the noise increases hugely when using an extractor pipe, even at the recommended diameter pipe and minimum extractor setting. For my small kitchen it would have been good to have a lower setting than minimum and it would have been quieter. I like that you can put the extractor on timed and it looks great.",Approved
"I’ve had mine installed for weeks now and still have not managed to get it working for the first time. Instruction manual is useless and instructions to actually get it to work for the first time are non existent. 
I have contacted AEG through their website form and via their social media with messages asking for help and still no response so it seems the customer service is also non existent. We are now stuck with new items in our new kitchen we cannot use due to this.",Approved
"issa great, love the touchscreen control panel, very aesthetically pleasing as it is very stylish and sleek, defo recommend :)",Approved
"The extractor is stylish, quiet to use and compact.",Approved
"Looks good, works well and not too complicated. We needed a simple integrated microwave to complement our new kitchen. Glad we chose this product.",Approved
"This dishwasher is really quiet and cleans dishes very well. The cutlery holder is quite poorly designed. You can fold the handle out of the way to load the cutlery, but if you have taller knives and forks you can't easily fold it back, making it awkward to pick up. If you leave the handle folded down, it takes up room in the dishwasher that could be used for plates. A traditional handle on a stork in the centre would be much better.",Approved
I was a little worried about buying this as I hadn’t actually been able to see it in person so was concerned about the size. Although expensive in comparison to all free standing microwaves this looks the part and matches the other AEG appliances. Seems to perform great.,Approved
"Well just had new kitchen and chose all AEG items it’s looks great microwave is a joy to use, fridge brilliant and oven fab love them all, so recommend them all also bought a hob again very please.",Approved
"This we have found to be a good microwave. It is very quiet when in use, and the best feature we like is the ease at which you can change the power settings, depending on what you are cooking. It is touch screen and so easy. It also looks good in our new kitchen!",Approved
"Great hob, easy to use and really easy to clean after use. Would recommend and 5 star rating",Approved
I am pleased with this microwave although a little smaller inside. Only one drawback is that you have to be very careful when taking out the rack as unfortunately we caught the glass turntable and it fell out and broke into pieces and had to order a new glass turntable. It does however do the job of a microwave and looks smart in the kitchen unit.,Approved
Love this cooker. Hob has as quick a response as gas. Ovens good size and heat up quickly with many different cooking options.,Approved
"I really like the features to let you clean this oven with ease. You can remove the glass with little levers and clean up any drips of liquid that get between the panes - something that I really didn't like about our previous oven. The slide out tray option is great for roasting meat and makes it much safer and more convenient to baste. I was a bit concerned that I wouldn't be able to comfortably make a family roast in the split oven due to its size, but I've been pleasantly surprised as there are lots of shelves so that hasn't been a problem.",Approved
"My wife is in raptures with the cooker. One word of advice, read the handbook,take your time and play with the controls before you commit to using the cooker.",Approved
"Overall a good looking and a spacious fridge, however the salad crisper drawers are very flimsy. One was drawers was cracked on delivery and we are still waiting for a replacement to be delivered, it has been over two weeks........",Rejected
"Would be even better if could spin at 1600 on a 20 minute wash. ""On/Off"" switch not good - I press it and don't know whether it has worked or not, just have to wait and see if the panel lights up - frustrating. But still love the quiet spin, the huge capacity and the excellent wash performance. Keep up the good work!",Approved
"The main oven shelf had not been soldered, had 3 ovens delivered before I got one where the shelf was not hanging off. Presumably a faulty batch but I just hope it stands the test of time.",Approved
"I purchased this cooker as a replacement to one I had for over 15 years not same make but same build quality. I am more than happy with this cooker so far, getting used to all the features, easy to clean hob, and if you need to, you can take glass out of oven doors to clean, could not do that with last one..
very pleased with this cooker, made a perfect Victoria sponge cake.",Approved
Always preferred gas to electric but this is fantastic. Love the burner one and it’s really effective. Just wish there was a way to make the rings easier to clean but I guess it’s inevitable with gas.,Approved
So far so good. Still learning with regard to operation but loving it so far,Approved
"Great fridge. Plenty of space,quiet and efficient.",Approved
Fantastic Fridge Freezer - so quiet to run and so simple to set up (just plug in and go). Plenty of space with a good selection of different sized trays to place a variety of items in from Milk to Cheese etc. The AEG Freezer has nice deep compartments which allows you to add in more items and makes better use of the space.,Approved
Fantastic cooker. Solid and well built. The only flaws are not being able to clean easily around the controls and the programmable timer isn't that easy to set.,Approved
"Great cooker and hub top, mondern and easy to clean.",Approved
Really pleased with the cooker. Excellent range of cooking programmes and easy to set and use. Looks really nice too. Good quality feels like its built to last.. Easy to clean too.,Approved
"the cooker timing clock is touch sensitive and not very responsive to the touch also the count down timer the one we use most, is the last item to access which makes it more difficult for us to use.",Approved
"I bought this one just before Christmas 2017 as my old one failed completely after 8 years. I have a matching freezer so needed to replace with a similar unit. The old one was completely irreparable, I was very disappointed and could have done without the problem just before Christmas.",Approved
"I am very happy with the cooker and it’s features. Would heartily recommend it to anyone, however one small design fault; the plastic vapour vents at the rear of the hob. My youngsters making a fry-up melted one of them. It was too easy to do. I avoid placing too wide pans at the rear, but this is something that could be rectified at the design level.",Approved
It's definitely a good quality machine but I still need to find a way to get the cloths out without wrinkles. Do you have any tip? (beside putting 2 pieces of cloths at the time!.. I have 3 kids!),Approved
"AEG has high standards and manages to satisfy the clients of any generation.The products meets all Health and Safety standards and regulations:the glass top cuts the gas off;triple glassed oven doors are safe for young children to touch,etcThe small oven is not just for grilling, but can be used for baking.",Rejected
Great design. Lots of room for fresh veg and salad. Good bottle rack. Lots of shelf space.,Approved
"for the past 12 years had bosch with excellent results, now when there is no timer do not know when the clothes will be dried. it takes about 3 hours to dry not a full load, later today a technician will come to help us, hope he will correct the way we use it.",Approved
Good looking fridge with loads of room. Bigger than a lot of other fridges. Easy to use and really looks quality. Also very quiet and does exactly what it says on the tin. Led lighting lights up the fridge a treat.,Approved
Seems OK so far. Its nothing special just a larder fridge. We chose AEG due to the 5 year guarantee and the price from J. Lewis was much the same as any supplier on the net.,Rejected
"Really sturdy cooker, lovely to use and clean. Looks great very happy",Approved
"Wasn’t the cheapest but fits it with our kitchen perfectly. Wanted a microwave only not a combined unit. Simple to operate, works well and easy to clean.",Approved
"I was looking for a matched pair of tall freezer and fridge and considered many makes but settled on this model, I had read a couple of comments about the noise it makes in operation but can tell you ours is absolutely silent, in fact I have to keep checking it is actually running.
In terms of style it looks fantastic and shows no finger prints on the stainless steel door.
The only criticism I have about this purchase is the instructions are virtually non existent, a flimsy couple of pages with generic pictures and very little text.
I would definitely recommend this product and I am very pleased with my purchase.",Approved
"this lovely fridge has just one problem, its made my kitchen look tired so its now costing me over 5k to update my units!!!",Approved
Solid and function meets and exceeds expectations. Main oven is fantastic.,Approved
We've not used all the features yet but what we have used has worked really. Like that you can change the power.,Approved
"After much research we decided to go with AEG. Delighted to say that we have not been disappointed. Firstly it looks great, it’s apoearance is of a high value item. It’s also well designed with a lot of well thought out features. 
Performance has been impeccable thus far. 
On this basis we wouldn’t think twice about recommending AEG.",Approved
"Very satisfied with our fridge freezer. It does all it says it is supposed to do , and looks extremely smart and operates to a high standard",Approved
This product is very excellent. I have no problem with this device. I will recommend it to every body. that is nice.,Approved
"This purchase was to replace our original microwave which has a broken catch mechanism, very disappointing in itself.
New model simpler to use.",Approved
"Unfortunately the poor design of the vent system on this oven means it bellows out steam from the back whenever you use the ovens. This means you need to have the extractor fan on the whole time even when you are not using the hob. Shop I bought it from said it's the design so unfortunately I am stuck with it. In addition the hob only has one large ring, which we knew before purchasing, but I presumed the other rings would be more powerful. This means there's lots of moving around of saucepans needed when cooking the family meal. Lastly the grill has no handle so oven gloves are needed to pull it out when checking the food being grilled. Not impressed at all and I certainly wished I had bought another oven.",Approved
"I have had my cooker, AEG 49002-VMN, for two years and in that time I have had a new main cooker door, because the original literally dropped off, a new top oven door and most recently, whilst repairing the top oven door the engineer said I needed a new hinge for the main oven door. The new hinge was fitted just prior to Christmas (2014). However I have had to call the engineer again to say the oven door still does not fit properly and that the upper hinge is faulty. Is this an indication of a design fault or do I have a rogue model?",Approved
"I love this stove. Simple to use and as there are no knobs, very easy to keep clean! Very impressed with the features on both hob and the ovens - and they do the job perfectly!",Approved
This is an amazing product. Love the way it looks but mostly love the way it does the job. The power of induction is unbelievable and the response to higher or lower temperatures is instant! The fact that it has no nobs or display screens is the bonus part. Cleaning it it’s a pleasure and doing so u can never burn your skin even after just removing a very hot pot.... what can I say FANTASTIC! Recommend this product ? Oh YES!!,Approved
"On the whole it is a very good cooker, I would have preferred to have a grill pan with a handle, and u less I’m doing something wrong the grill does not seem very efficient, it seems to take a long to e to do toast",Approved
I have always cooked with gas so to change to electric at 62 years old has been a massive step. I only wish I had done it years ago. This cooker is amazing and has inspired me to start baking again. I love it and highly recommend it.,Approved
It looks great but two of the four hobs have stopped working.,Approved
I just purchased 5 AEG products and each one is great quality and very easy to use really pleased glad I switched,Approved

Cannot fault this appliance up to press although it would have been nice to have included an under shelf bottle rack for wine etc.,Approved
"I brought this washing machine for its low noise levels, and it lives up to expectations, very quiet. Also the large drum means we have halved the loads we do, saving time and money.",Approved
I keep expecting the door handle to break it does not seem capable of opening the door.,Approved
Very spacious and well designed appliance. Love it!,Approved
"This is a great fridge freezer. It replaces a 14 year old one that only had one feature, and that was the set temp. So this is a big step forward for us, and a simple feature like the door open alarm has already alerted us once...The Coolmatic function is especially useful to us as we shop fortnightly and end up filling the fridge with a lot of produce that is at room temperature. Also its the first feature you get to when you press the Mode button, excellent decision from the designers.",Approved
Fast to come to temp .lovely to use and keep clean .,Approved
"great features, looks stylish and induction hob the best.",Approved
"It seems odd that the smallest hot plate is at the back - making a sauce requires stirring, in a small saucepan, and leaning over the hob is uncomfortable and dangerous, too, if the front (large) hob is in use. It's a shame that smaller pans cannot be used on all hot plates.
Other than that - fabulous!t",Rejected
Easy to use with help of booklet. All my efforts roasting and baking have turned out brilliantly so far. I wanted a good top oven for times when bending to lift out heavy pans gets too much and this cooker has just that. It would have been nice to have a special free accompanying cookbook to inspire me to even greater baking achievements!,Approved
"Perfect cooker, easy control, no issues with burning or changing temps",Approved
"Over the year I have always bought good quality washing machine hence the reason I have not had to purchase so many, 
i bought this AEG because it looked right, the way it feels, little things like when you open the door and touch the controls it feel like it is made to last, but this counts for nothing if it doesn't wash the laundry to a very high standard and I am happy to say its right up there with the best,
we use the washing machine most days,",Approved
"My washing seems to come out much cleaner than it ever has before and it is extremely economical to run, well worth the money.",Approved
"Our first built in, it's large, but not as big as the freestanding one that we had, no matter, that got moved to the garage, just in case!
This one fits all we need, has good shelf adjustment, excellent cooling and easily is adjustable,.",Approved
Absolutely love this. Extra light weight and swivel head makes moving it around a breeze. Especially good as i suffer joint pain. Sucks up all the dirt and cat hair for full 45 mins running time. Bought it on recommendation from my mum who loves hers too.,Approved
We are now reporting this for the fourth time. Adjustments and fan changed have not resolved this fault.,Approved
We had to replace the existing fridge/freezer as it was not working properly. When offered this model it seemed just what we needed. It has fulfilled our expectations and we would not hesitate to recommend this product,Approved
Does exactly what I want it to do. Massive fridge area lights not too bright,Approved
AEG are selling this product but has not warranty. Tried calling various numbers 03445 613 613 they keep sending me round and round in circles. There is No Number for MIO MODO Portable Coffee Machine Repairs. This was bought from AEG Direct.,Rejected
Exceptional cooling & spacious interior. Chosen because of quality name & not disappointed with product,Approved
This machine is satisfactory although more complicated to use than my previous AEG machine.,Approved
"after having several A.E.G. products decided to try our first kitchen appliance. works well comes up to temperature quickly, quiet efficient.",Approved
"If I had to have a ""chuckle"" at any thing about the fridge,
It would be the inclusion of the ""child proof lock"" for the settings panel, at over 6 feet high when set in the cabinet, I fail to see how a child will reach them ? ?",Approved
"We are very pleased with the drier. As we have two grandchildren who stay with us regularly, we need to wash and dry their clothes pretty quickly. The job is done perfectly every time. Whether we need them 'iron"" dry or ""cupboard"" dry, it is done without fuss. Simple to use, too!",Approved
Purchased to replace a condenser drier I am delighted with this driers performance and time saved on drying. The flexibility of having 3 positions for the exhaust pipe is a big bonus as many driers now only have the rear position. My only regret is I didn’t buy one before I did.,Approved
"As with my previous aeg, this is excellent but I feel slightly too complicated. The controls and features are too complicated and so are the instructions. I find myself constantly referring to the manual. 
Aside from that, the adjustable feet aren’t quite high enough to meet my counter top so do check. Additionally there is no stop on them so if you twist them too far they just fall out which is frankly poor. 
But it works beautifully, very fast to heat up too.",Approved
"Vented tumble dryer , easy to install, easy to operate, fast drying times, fresh soft clothes, delay timer so it can be set on cheap night time electricity, easy to clean filter, large opening door. great all round a big thumbs up! it is much better than the heat pump dryer it replaced and a quarter of the cost.",Approved
Awesome!!!!! Cooked my first roast and turned out ok,Approved
"If you're looking for a replacement for an old vented dryer, then this is the one which impresses for quietness, , large door opening to ease loading and sensor drying which protects modern synthetic ""technical"" wear.",Approved
"Had this to replace my condenser dryer, would highly recommend. It drys everything really well, with a choice of how much moisture you want removed.",Approved
"I love the fact you can control the temperature for various hot drinks as I love my herbal teas and coffee. 
I love the stylish design and it's easy to keep clean.",Approved
We bought this cooker because of the AEG brand we have not been disappointed and look forward to many years using it,Approved
The dryer is well built and functions well but compared with out previous 28 year old machine is slightly more noisy. In my opinion it would not be suitable for an open plan area. Filter needs cleaning after only one or two uses which is a bit of a nuisance.,Approved
I bought this to replace my old tassimo machine and I’m so glad i did. It’s very stylish as well aa being quiet,Approved
This is easy to use and the instructions are clear. The washing comes out perfectly,Approved
"Makes delicious coffee, love the frothy milk, makes great lattes and cappuccinos, as good as the leading coffee houses.",Approved
Great product I think I will enjoy for years to come,Approved
Coffee better than competitors and great variety on offer including hot chocolate and frother,Approved
"This has to be the best cooker ive ever used , boils water super fast , the oven is fantastic for all round cooking with many different functions , simply a fantastic cooker",Approved
Water tank is of good size. Quick to produce coffee. Design looks good and sturdy yet easy to care for. Easy care product and looks good on worktop. See a demo and you will purchase.,Approved
"I just love this coffee machine, makes great frothy lattes & cappuccinos. Never drank so much coffee!",Approved
setting the temperature is stupid it is all hit and miss if you fitted a indication clock in would help,Approved
"I wish we had had one of these before. It is superbly designed, superbly constructed, well thought out , and out performs any other oven that we have owned.",Approved
This tumble dryer has multiple programmes for a variety of drying choices and the large drum prevents creasing.,Approved
Great coffee from this machine. The milk frother cup can be a bit difficult to get in and out though,Approved
Great coffee machine the milk frothing is excellent and overall time to make a coffee is very good. Easy to keep clean and looks good,Approved
Handbook very poorly written. touch controls fiddley.,Approved
"Great design, slick, stylish, efficient and brilliant!",Rejected
The hose went after two days. Got something stuck in hose had to break the housing to clear the blockage apart from that it's good for the stairs.,Approved
This is the best coffee maker I have ever purchased.... the coffee tastes just as good any coffee shops ... highly recommended,Approved
"Easy to use and operate but there something’s that you need to be aware of. It sometimes leaks if you don’t put the water holder in firmly, also the milk frothed top needs to placed correctly. Once you’ve mastered all the little quirks it’s a great little machine, makes a great cappuccino or latte, I love it.",Approved
"Love my new coffee maker, it makes great coffee and the best feature is the fluffy milk of the top",Approved
"I've wanted to replace my solid-plate electric hob since I inherited it with my current flat. After a lifetime largely spent cooking on gas, I really disliked having to cook on such an unresponsive hob. This induction hob makes cooking so much more enjoyable, plus I am saving reducing fuel consumption. Win, win!",Approved
"So far so good, purchased late December, only negative comment is that the receptacle collecting used capsules is too small. But that is also an indication that we are using it a lot",Approved
I would recommend this machine to anyone. I make lattes every morning and love it xx,Approved
"Bad product functionality and design, as claims to have child lock, but it doesnt lock power button, so is pointless.
First dryer supplied was faulty, on contacting AEG customer support was told, I would have to wait a week to have appliance assessed befor they would issue an uplift code to my supplier.
that was obviously unacceptable, and my supplyer replaced it under the consumer act.
woman on AEG customer seervice was arogant, and seemed to imply i didnt know how to use appliance.
the bad quality controle is probably due to it being assembled in poland, as thhis seems to be an issue with a lot of supplyers.",Rejected
"Powerful quiet easy to manage and maintain. Fluff collects in a bin at the front. Water can be used to water plants and vases of flowers. Cuts drying time. If I feel they are damp I just hang them on the banister and they dry in natural air in no time, that does the trick. Easy to use.",Approved
Great product to use since we received it. I managed to practice most of the functionality without experiencing any issues.,Approved
Fast and responsive hob. A joy to use. Would recommend.,Approved
It is a great looking dryer with impressive features but the sensors are too sensitive and it keeps stopping without drying.,Approved
"This is a good looking piece of kitchen furniture and cooks beautifully. However the quality is not good enough. 1. The grill is on or off, takes an age to light and on occasion has just gone off. (An engineer is due to visit) 2. The timer is so quiet that even stood next to the cooker it is hard to hear over the sound of a sizzling wok. (Engineer to look at). 3. The removable slides in the top oven / grill fell out whilst adjusting the rack mid cook, they had not been fitted properly prior to delivery. 4. The grill pan is huge nbut no handle, the rack is twisted we await a replacement. 
This could be an excellent cooker if the designers had not cut corners when designing its features.",Approved
"Can't begin to tell you how happy I am with my new cooker. In particular I like the easy clean features, it still looks like it came straight out of the showroom. It's extremely easy to use and seems to be more efficient than my previous cooker.",Approved
Only used my new cooker 3 times when the cooling fan in the top oven became faulty.Still on 1hour after the oven had been switched off.Had to turn off at the mains.Now it comes on every time I switch the electric back on.Also the top oven keeps going out.I light it to pre-heat..go back 15 mins later to find that its gone out.Rang for an engineer who said the thermostat was faulty but told they couldn't get one to repair it.Went back to the retailer who contacted AEG who said they could repair it.Going round in circles at the moment with a NEW cooker that's faulty.NOT HAPPY!!!!,Approved
This item has a lovely sleek streamlined appearance. I love the power setting on the plates that bring your pans to the boil in double quick time.,Approved
"Absolutely thrilled with my purchase ! 
Makes the best home coffee I have ever

I have only had this a couple of weeks and am sill getting used to it but so far so good.,Approved
if you have ever read a review before you'll know how good this one is :),Approved
"So far this has proved to be a great buy. With everything working competently. The programmes are clearly described in the booklet, although I have not yet tried the probe. The grill does seem to be somewhat inefficient, and heats very slowly. Results are good. But it does take ages t o grill a rasher of bacon! I am looking forward to c to the self cleaning aspect.",Approved
"Simple to use, easy to keep clean and most importantly produces great coffee from an Espresso to a cappuccino.",Approved
"Pleased with product quality and layout
It is easy to use, clean and keep fresh",Approved
"Only one month old, had two engineers and one replacement cooker. Not what was expected for an appliance of this price.",Approved
The oven is just perfect I should have had one years ago. After the first few days of use I started getting to know it and I have never looked back. The oven is a lot hotter than my last one and cooks a lot quicker so I am looking forward to some good meals and lower energy bills,Approved

Much quieter than my previous washing machine and the drum is a lot bigger,Approved
"The product was delivered from Currys . After installation I discovered the next day that the cooling fan had not switched off. I then spent two and a half hours trying, unsuccessfully, to contact your Service Centre. I then found an address for you M.Ds Office. Via this address I did finally manage to make a booking for this Friday (21/9/18).
As you can imagine I was less than impressed initially, in receiving a product I had paid £900 for that was not in full working order and then being unable to contact your Service Centre.",Rejected
"I was a little nervous replacing my old cooker, after a lot of deliberating I'm glad I chose this one. Priced at the top of my budget the AEG has all the features I wanted. 
So far I have found that it cooks everything evenly, everything feels solid and well made. 
I did have a teething problem with the digital clock in the beginning which seems to have sorted its self out.
My only negative would be the safety baron the back of the shelves it makes it difficult to position the shelves or when putting the grill tray in.",Approved
This cooker is the first item to be delivered into what will be a high class purpose built kitchen in our new retirement abode. It is working at present in relatively primitive conditions but it is living up to expectations after having previous experience of an induction hob cooker with knob controls which give fantastic sensitivity to the cooking process. We have noted the weight of the appliance is far greater than that of other products looked at which suggests far greater quality of product. We have no doubt we have made a good investment.,Approved
The larger than normal oven with three shelves gives you more cooking space as does the second oven with integrated grill. The hob with the wok burner gives you more heat for stir frying and bringing liquids to the boil. The glass lid makes for a stylish and practical clean finish. The look of the stainless steel overall finish really looks great in the kitchen.,Approved
"It may be expensive but it feels quality and my wife loves it, accurate thermostat and even cooking, it's also quiet and easy to use. Having had surface controls on previous induction hob we find the knobs less hassle.",Approved
We had this installed into our cupboard unit and it looks great. Easy to use and lots of settings making it very versatile. Would recommend.,Approved
if you have i would sure like to know. i can't think of a time that i have seen anyone eat so many.,Approved
"I bought this machine after having a Nespresso machine and am so glad that I did so. The coffee so much nicer even if it does take longer to prepare. We have tried most of the capsules now and really enjoy the coffee in its various ways. I would certainly recommend trying one of these machines if you are a lover of a good cup,of coffee.",Approved

"Initially, the number of heating elements invoilved quite a long 'burning off' period. But the cooker has worked faultlessly since.
The instructions are comprehensive and clear, with no techno-babble or jargon.
The build quality and cleaning features are first class.
The timing & delay start oven features are logical and user friendly.
The insulation on the main oven is so good, that the top oven and door remain 'touch cool' and child safe.
This brings me to my only dissapointment; - on my previous cooker, the lesser oven insulation allowed me to warm plates in in the top oven without turning it on. The insulation on the AEG prevents any heat escape in this directoion. The lowest temperature in the top oven is too hot for plate warming, so I would add a 'plate warming' setting to the top oven.

Othen that that minor observation, a first class product and a very satisfied customer!!",Approved
Amazing all rounder . The cookers really standing up the the quality I no you get when you buy a Aeg product,Approved
"Purchased this cooker 5 months ago and both my wife and myself have been very pleased with the results. I would definitely have recommended this cooker until today when my wife opened the lower oven door and it fell off! The door was very heavy and extremely hot. She was lucky not to receive serious injury.
Not what one would expect from any household appliance let alone one costing over £1000.",Rejected

"We have had this cooker since Easter 2014. If I paid this much money again for a free-standing cooker I would expect:
1. Accurate temps in the ovens. When set to 180 degrees for example it only comes up to about 160. The repair man said to expect 15% variation in temps, but I do NOT agree.
2. Shelves that are flat, not basket shaped. Very difficult to get flat trays in and out.
3. A grill that GRILLS - not bakes from the top.
4. A grill pan small enough to fit in a normal kitchen sink.
5. An over door that is properly sealed. The lower oven door on this cooker leaks heat.
6. If you lift a steamy pan lid and water drips onto the surface, the entire hob surface switches off. That takes some getting used to.
7. A timer that is simple to use. It should be possible to press 'timer', then the exact time.
Whoever designed this cooker hasn't done a lot of cooking, I would suspect! Apart from that it looks nice and is easy to clean.",Approved
First time user of induction but really impressed although I am still getting used to the controls.,Approved
Bought this for using in my car. It has a good powerful motor for suction but I was disappointed that the hose was not longer. It is difficult to stretch into areas of the car because the hose is short which makes it difficult to handle.,Approved

Our first induction hob and its doing a great job and saving energy.,Approved
"This dishwasher was installed as part of our new build. The racking i find too small and we can't fit too many bowls into the top or bottom. Pint glasses can't be lent on the top, half the time they fall over which is very frustrating. I wish we had chosen one our self or looked at the spec before we agreed on this!",Approved
Having used the hob for several weeks now can't complain. Its easy design and use of ease makes for a great kitchen appliance.,Approved
This dishwasher has comprehensive control features and excellent washing results. My only reservation is that the top cutlery drawer prevents average size small plates fitting into the upper basket.,Approved

"This washing machine was bought as part of a fitted kitchen and I have had a few issues. Within 6 months the motor had burnt out and needed replacing.

One of the drawer rails had a piece missing and so the drawer stuck on use. Eventually managed to get the correct piece though while waiting another drawer didn't run smoothly. The engineer appears to have fixed it but slightly disappointed in the quality as a result.,Approved
"The Freezer supplied was not fit for purpose I made a formal complaint via an e-mail (see Below) to AEG on 10 August that was read on 10 August by Shabana Khatoon I am still (22 August) awaiting a reply. 

""Please accept and treat this e-mail as a formal complaint. 

Background.

I purchased an AEG Freezer A72710GNX0, Type FZFF250, Product 925052766-
03, Serial 80510065 as part of a larger order to outfit a new kitchen
from Purewell Electrical Christchurch; it was delivered on 8 June with
the full white goods order, stored in its original packaging within an
integral garage, opened 18 July and connect on 19 July. These dates
can be supported by the kitchen fitter and kitchen/utility room floor
fitter. The Freezer failed 31 August (I emailed a question to AEG as
advised on the website and to date have not received a reply) and due
to the design of the temperature read out this was not clear until late
1 August by which time the contents were ruined. I contacted the
authorised service centre on 2 August who advised that the earliest an
engineer would visit would be Monday 6 August. They then passed me
onto AEG on 08445 612612. AEG stated that the 30-day exchange period
commenced on delivery not connection and that the Freezer had to be
repaired pending the engineers report.

The engineer inspected the Freezer on 6 August and concluded that the
appliance had a system fault and needed to be; drained, super sealed re-
gassed and a new compressor fitted; job number 888579. Having taken
further advice from an independent refrigeration engineer it would
appear that this type of repair is conducted on an old appliance to get
“a couple more years out of it” and should not be done on a new
Freezer. 
The engineers report is in and I am aware that Purewell have spoken to
the AEG representative, however having heard nothing on 9 August I
called the repair people on 034445 610643 and asked for an update. The
manager Steve Barns told me they had not ordered the necessary parts as
such extensive work (job 3-4 hours plus parts) was not a sensible
course of action on a Freezer that had only been running for 12 days;
he assumed the Freezer was being replaced. Purewell eventually had a
response from AEG (after considerable pressure) and stated that AEG
would replace the Freezer. As Purewell did not have one in stock they
had asked AEG to deliver direct as that would be quicker. I was told
AEG would contact me. In addition, on 9 August I received an e-mail
from GBX Customer Service who said AEG customer care would be in touch
with me directly to date no contact.

By 13:00 10 August 2018 I had not heard from AEG so I called them on
08445 612612. I attempted 6 times only once speaking to an operative
“Lizzie” I told her the issue she took my name and address asked me to
wait and then hung up. I then tried 03445 611 611, the number given
for customer care on the internet, again with no success in talking to
anyone. To date a new freezer has spent more time broken than working
and I am left with a broken freezer with a house full of family and
guests this weekend for a birthday party and the bill for a freezer
full of food that had to be thrown away.
 
1. Notwithstanding the delivery date the Freezer was not connected
until 19 Jul and that is for all practical purposes when the 30-day
period should commence; as such I reject the Freezer and would like it
replaced immediately as agreed.
2. I would be grateful for your comments on the above, for contact
details see below.",Rejected
Well designed good looking and practical fridge. Great frost matic feature. Wish I had upgraded my old fridge freezer sooner.,Approved

Good design and easy to use love the self clean oven function,Approved
"Just had a new fitted kitchen put in with all new appliances, the fridge/freezer looks great and as its all build in it finishers the kitchen off. love the way when you open the door the temperature lights up .",Approved
"I think this product is excellent. It runs quietly and is very convenient to use. It has lots of space. The door and handle are an excellent design. I love the stylish stainless steel finish and the temperature display is subtle but very visible. The wheels at the back make it very easy to move around the floor to get it into position.
I would highly recommend this product",Approved
"Freezer is spacious, it does everything that you need in a freezer. Can be noisy at times.",Approved
originally bought american fridge freezer but freezer part was very small for our needs even though it had seven compartments. we decided to buy a stand alone freezer to stand along side it to maximize our freezer options after careful consideration we decided the aeg A72710GNX1 model fitted our needs and were glad we did its very spacious has seven compartments five of whch are pull out drawers the other two are pull down compartment talk about space there is plenty of room for your monthly shopping never mind your weekly . internal light is handy controls are easy to use when we bought it there was a added bonus of a five year guarantee cant say anything bad about this freezer,Approved
"I was chosen by AEG to receive this product free, in return for writing a frank & honest review for the product.
I absolutely love this oven, I cannot fault its performance at steam cooking. I have a really busy household, & anything that can cut cooking time down, as well as keeping things moist & retaining flavour is a big plus in my book!!!
I'm not sure about you, but with all the health scares about red meat etc, our family eats lots of chicken throughout the week. One of my biggest bugbears has been how to keep the moisture in the chicken so that it doesnt dry out & lose its flavour, using the steam function the chicken is so moist & tender! The boys absolutely love Lasagne, previously I would have problems with the pasta sheets sometimes seeming chewy, & the top going hard & crispy, no matter how many different ways I tried to cook it.....since using the steam function it doesn't go hard & crispy on top & the whole lasagne tastes fantastic!!! Its the same when I've cooked Potatoes Delphinoise, the potatoes are all lovely & fluffy & doesnt dry out too much!!!. I've also tried Lamb shanks, which I would usually do in a slow cooker, but I got just as good results in a much quicker time using the steam setting.
I've tried out the Pizza setting too, it keeps the base crispy, yet the centre/top is still moist!!!
Its actually given me the cooking bug again, & I've started looking for new recipes to try out!!! So even the Other half is pleased! lol
If there was one thing that I would change, it would be a separate grill, as you cant grill something & then cook something in the oven at the same time, but other than that, I can most definitely recommend this product!!!",Approved
A very poor product. The microwave failed to work after 5 months of use. This is very unreliable especially if you rely on microwaved meals because of health issues.,Approved
"Good:
- Washes clothes very well
- Big capacity
- Lots of functions that really work (anti cress, time saver, stains, etc).

Bad:
- Extremely noisy! Never had washing machine so noisy in my life (even in 80ties). Is shakes the whole floor in the kitchen when spinning. I tried to level it, but it didn't improve at all. You cannot use it at night - even at two floors above in my bedroom you can still hear it washing/spinning!
- Smelly! Moisture builds up in the machine until is smelly. This again never happen to any previous washing machine I had.
- Drying makes worrying noises (like creaks.)",Approved
"Great freezer. Is like a tardis, can get so much in it. Good looking and efficient. Very happy with it.",Approved
"This is quite a useful machine but - 
Using the hose it seems it is designed for left handed people
When using the hose air blows out of the bottom of the machine which tends to blow away the items you are trying to suck up. 
The dust bag has very limited capacity.
But it sucks well and has a long flex - very useful for stairs.",Approved
Every thing we have tried cooking has been perfect and it is easily cleaned. Looking forward to cooking our first Christmas dinner for the family. I am sure the will be impressed.,Approved
"Great. I have used it for Tasty Pizza , roasted Beef and Lamb stuffed eagplannet and more ..",Approved
"Great features easy to use and very quiet, comes with lots of trays and shelves",Approved
Colour is excellent. Knobs could be less wobbly. Lower oven really should have a grill. Markers for temp etc shoukd be on oven and not knobs..very difficult to read the at shoulder height or above.,Approved
Easy to use oven looks great. As to reliability don’t know as only had few weeks,Approved
quite powerful easy to use easy to carry up and down the stairs simple to empty,Approved
"Cons
- Very Bad Design of upper basket, glasses always fall over.
- Had an issue during installation (error code), impossible to contact tech support - in the end decided to leave a message via online support, still no response 1 month later.
- Very long wash cycles - totally un-necessary.

Our 10 year old Beko budget washer was superior in every way,",Approved
"Very good product, however the unit makes a clicking sound when more than one ring is on. May not have bought the product if this was known at the time of purchase.",Approved
Very quick and quiet - and was a good price - also liked 5 year guarantee!,Approved
Great washer still waiting for my manufactureres special offer rebate,Approved
"I purchased an AEG washer to replace a broken Miele machine and Iam extremely pleased with my purchase. It has lots of features, washes really well and is quieter than the old machine. Looks good too.",Approved
Have just purchased my second AEG cooker in twenty years hope it lasts as long. Have had it a few weeks so i am still learning how to use it so far all seems good. I have noticed that the oven and the hob are a lot quicker than my old one but I am having to look at the instruction booklet all the time.,Approved
"We are very happy with this - simple to use, large door, quiet, economic",Approved
"This is my first AEG washing machine, it is so quiet I forget that it has completed the cycle! Would certainly buy another.",Approved
What can I say. Cleans absolutely brilliantly. Recommended.,Approved
"product design is excellent, easy to use and great portability. I chose the right machine.",Approved
"We have been surprised how good this cooker is. The speed of heating water for example is phenomanal. Both Ovens are of an excelent size and the temprature control is far better and accurate tha any other cooker we have used. It is also gret that you can set both oven to different methods of heating, eg for grilling or baking one other good feature is a light in the top oven. Overell an excellent product",Approved
"Does a good job, but wish it could have been a modicum lighter in weight. I am guessing the weight is indicative of it's good quality. I can sit on the stairs to use it, so using it is fine. Saves me the awkward use of my full sized Dyson for the stairs.",Approved

Ideal for the car and for the stairs .has a sharp tool that enables the vacuum to get into tight corners.ideal for a family car with kids cake crumbs and other bits that get unto tight crevices.,Approved
"lightweight unit , long lead, powerful motor , ideal for cleaning even my builders van.",Approved
"This is a very smart looking freezer with lots of space for an under-counter model. I like having the controls and indicators on the outside, so that you can see that all is as it should be without having to open the door. The outside finish is excellent and needs no more than a damp dust to keep it looking good. I would definitely recommend this freezer.",Approved
I am very pleased with your product it’s fast it is the best decision I have ever made.It is so easy to Clean not like my old gas cooker.,Approved
"Very well thought out cooker, not over complicated when you're used to it. Only fault I can find is spacing of shelves in main oven isn't quite flexible enough, when all three shelves are in use some deep dishes will not fit. On the whole very impressed.",Approved
Well made and very powerful vac. Good length of power lead.it has a very convenient slot for putting the nozzle tool. Brilliant,Approved

"I really wanted this 5-year warranted AEG knob-less, touch-screen, induction cooker to replace our dilapidated Electrolux knob-less machine. After importing it because it was not available in Ireland, we have found it a great pleasure to use and Christmas fared well and so far through the year ....

The baked glazed ham looked as from a textbook. The turkey too, excelled. As for the homemade mince pies and brown soda breads churned out .... words cannot describe the aromas, flavours and warmth provided. Our culinary output and quality has definitely ""upped"" a notch by these very good even-cooking larger ovens,

So the ovens are great ... except that for nearly 1000 pounds/euros AEG were a bit stingy with the oven-hardware provided .... the new machine came with one-only pan for the upper grill (i imagine) and NO roasting pan with solid trivet for the main oven .... this lack of respect for the quality domestic cook startles me and is an insult to my wallet that supports this cooker and AEG !!!

Also we have NOT received the thermometer thingy that regulates the oven cooking of joints !!! ..... i am so very patient .... ""I"" can hear you, say ?

Anyway the ovens ARE a little wider than our previous Electrolux machine .....again ...the grill-pan supplied is a piece of tatty enameled tin, with no handling method .....

And so then i discovered the induction hob on top of these two ovens and this was a wondrous revelation for me !

After we rejected most of our ""old"" incompatible cookware and investing serious loot in new induction ""safe"" wares i am poorer but much wealthier !
This really is a very powerful and super-responsive cooking hob. 

I love being able to leave my stirring-wooden spoon on a plate on the hob beside the boiling pot with zero risk and the feel-good effect of the energy-efficiency while cooking really does for my green halo ....... there is a sense of being before an altar, preparing the days offerings for the improvement of body and soul ............ (tmi methinks ?!?)

If i wasn't so used-to oven cooking I would be tempted to do-without the ovens and go the ""full-monty"" with the induction hob and pot-ovens and microwave grills.... but we are a traditional house that bakes, roasts, dries chilies, herbs, fruits and makes jams, jellies, juices, ...... so this responsive hob is a revelation.

ASSIDE : i love the Christmas Present we got of the AEG MAXISENSE PLANCHA GRILL which is a heavy kind-of cast-iron grill that spreads itself across two of the synced- induction rings. 
It gets SO hot you can sear steaks and do amazing things with scallops, prawns and whole fish that really only get experienced on holidays !!
You would think that these expensive accessories should come with hard to find silicone-grips !! (HOB-to-TABLE)

...and while i think of it ...Why do AEG not provide a couple of thin silicone mats to put on the glass induction hob to limit the scratching of your pots, kettle, pans etc.... ? .... they work fine and you can cook ""through"" them... no problem !!! .... the hob stays sparkling clean !!... the pots etc are reassuringly gripped by the silicone and cannot scratch the surface .... we use very thin oven-baking sheets

.... and AEG PLEASE PAY ATTENTION ....
The ""communicating"" beeps from the controls are virtually inaudible ESPECIALLY if you are a little older than this century ?!.... can we increase the volume from the current sound level of a bleating-flea to something more humanly audible PLEASE !!!?

ALSO ...
The wonderful hob-feature to dial up maximum heat followed by a lower setting automatically is great but this feature could easily be expanded so that you can start at ANY setting and automatically settle on a simmer.

AND ...
Now that we can use our kettle on the hob it would be cool if we could (much more easily) program the induction to boil the kettle then automatically turn off ! (say ""one-touch 10 minutes"")
This suggested new feature would be particularly useful for brewing espresso !!

FINALLY ...
Why is the hob-cooling-fan SO noisy ?...... i think i may have to complain soon about this distraction !!

otherwise i would hope to continue to recommend this machine for at least 5 years after the warranty expires !!!",Approved
this product seems to be good when you first put it together but then it falls apart...what's that all about?,Approved
"Very impressed with this cooker, lots of features, all the functions work really well, it's easy to keep clean, both ovens have a light which is usefull, the induction elements on the hob are fantastic! the controls are well designed and simple to use, best of all when making yorkshire puddings they look& taste amazing, AEG are famous for quality and design and this appliance is a fine example. best cooker we have ever owned.",Approved

This little gem does a fantastic job.
It picks up really well, even pet hair.
It is so light compared to some and the head just skims around corners brilliantly.
Easy to put together, hand held attachment is also a great feature, also picks up well.Very simple to empty and needs little storage space.

the stainless steel finish is easy to clean and the product with its well designed controls is simple to use,Approved
We were sent this toaster under warranty to replace one that stopped working. It's brushed stainless which we would never chose as they finger print too easily but it works well and the count down feature is useful when you're waiting for your toast to cook. The bun rack is useless and is a separate item so has to be stored somewhere else. The integral one on the previous toaster was much better press a button and up it pops,Approved
"I bought this freezer in good faith but it soon went wrong. I found it incredibly difficult to get ANY help.
The red temp warning light started to pulse as though it wasn't maintaining temperature although the temp was set at -18.",Rejected
The Freezer is very quiet and has more space than you think. I love it that I don`t have to defrost it every so many months like my old freezer.,Approved
We find this cooker very easy to use with lots of features that make cooking easier.,Approved
"Great looking oven with smooth lines and light colour finish. It is very easy to use, there are many special features but from day one it is really straightforward to cook a family meal. This is my second AEG cooker and I am not disappointed!",Approved
"The freezer and fridge look perfect together, both were easy to set up and they were perfect for all the Christmas food.",Approved
Love the funky red panelling! And it cooks evenly and well without smelling!,Approved
"Lovely stainless steel/silver finish, stylushvdesign & easy to clean. A huge amount of storage space for a frost free undercounter model, best I could find. The 4 good size drawers make storage organisation simple & their clear finish makes finding things easy. The extra power boost button to freeze food as fast as possible is a useful feature too. I also like the digital temperature display so I know all is OK, there is an audible & flashing alarm if there is a failure causing temperature to drop below recommended level. I am extremely pleased I chose this freezer!",Approved
"We bought this to match our AEG fridge, and the two look great. Our freezer is under the counter, and though initially worried it might not be big enough, it's perfectly adequate for the two of us (we have the tall fridge). My only quibble is the size of the bottom, quick-freeze drawer - it's half-size, rather than full, and none of the drawers easily takes, say, three loaves of bread. But it's perfect otherwise, hence five stars overall. Love the fact that we don't have to de-frost it!",Approved
"It heats up quickly, seems to take longer to cook things set at the same temp as old cooker. Grill in top oven is not good for toast.",Approved
"Very good so far. Just getting used to it, but very pleased with size and shelving options. Plenty programmes to choose from.",Approved
"Nice looking, warms up very quickly and cooks evenly. Only gripes are that the timer is as basic as the 20 year old Neff it replaced, and again in comparison with the old cooker the controls feel flimsy. Whether they will last the test of time remains to be seen, but if we had our time over we would probably pay a bit more for Neff.",Approved
"my wife loves it, She cannot belive how advanced it is on her last 37 year old oven. So easy to clean Easy to instal, Just updated the wiring to a higher standard Love how it grills with door closed, our old on had to be left open. Much quicker cooking with the larger fan, Like how all the shelf holders come out for deep cleaning. Great buy.",Approved

"I think the vacuum cleaner handle is the worst ever. I keep accidentally switching off the vacuum cleaner because the heavy curtains pass past the handle, or my hand moving past it and touching the controls, which happens frequently. Very annoying...
And extremely silent is only true when switched off... It is less loud compared to other vacuum cleaners, but only on the lowest setting which is useless on a pile carpet... My cats go into hiding every time I roll out the vacuum cleaner.
But the worst is that the vacuum handle just 'snapped off' in the middle of vacuuming, I wasn't even putting pressure on the handle. This with a vacuum cleaner that is only on it's second box of vacuum bags, I don't have the vacuum cleaner that long yet.
A close look at the handle shows me that a thin piece of plastic goes into the metal telescopic tube, thus plastic trying to control metal... resulting in obvious breakage. I've had a quick look at ordering the handle, but the handle on it's own costs £33 and is not in stock. Might AEG have a lot of broken handles to repair at this moment and is this the reason why they are not in stock???
Not sure if I still have my proof of purchase to check if this fault will be repaired under the guarantee, but overall this vacuum cleaner has not impressed.",Approved
"AEG is a great brand and the design, functionality and quality of this unit is really good.
Looks really stylish and cools well.
It glides easily along the floors if you need to move rooms too.
2 Flaws:
1) AEG attach a massive sticker on the front of the unit that does not peel away, poor design for such a good looking unit. Took hours to carefully pick it away (Tip: Use WD40 to speed the process)
2) The unit remote can only be used with that remote, eg if you have a ""One For All"" style remote, it will not work. This is because AEG has not supplied the codes to manufacturers...come on AEG!
2 small flaws that make a big difference.
Overall a great A/C unit and I recommend",Approved

This is the second AEG oven we have had and the first one was faultless for ten years of heavy usage. When it developed a fault with the temperature control it was going to cost in the region of £250 for repair and given it's age and good service I elected to replace it with a similar oven for £299. This is excellent value for a quality product and if this oven is as good and reliable as the previous one we will be very pleased.,Approved
"Good looking a.c.u. with some good features such as timers, dehumidifier and remote control, but also some bad ones. The exhaust hose outlet is horizontal and uses 30cm of the hose and space to turn vertical, with another 30 cm of a fairly rigid hose to turn back horizontal to the window opening. There is no window adapter supplied unlike others of similar price. This machine does NOT evaporate the condensate so, contrary to the instructions, this a.c.u. DOES need a drain hose when in cool mode, or like me, you will find the cool mode turned off within 2 hours and, a flooded floor. AEG (who appear to be new comers to air conditioning) say you don't need the drain hose (correct when you first turn it on!) but have acknowledged that, you couldn't operate it overnight or make use of the timers without the drain hose in place. I have purchased a very large tray for the unit to sit in for drainage and a much longer flexible exhaust hose, to overcome these problems. You should also be aware that if exhausting through a window or door, the hose gets extremely hot to touch and, puts heat back into the room and negates some of the cooling. Overall, it does the job but others for a similar price could do it as well, without the problems.",Approved

"This product sets itself above the crowd because of its outstanding performance. Consuming just as much energy as my previous Amcor unit (about 1.2KW), it has *significantly* better cooling. Stand in front of it for too long and I'm sure you'd end up with frostbite! A lot quieter too, barely noticeable once you've got used to it. The dehumidifier works amazingly well, a constant drip-drip of water easily filling up a litre container inside an hour. The auto-fan is particularly useful; if the temperature difference is high, the fan is strong, once it get closer, the fan speed reduces and the quieter it gets. And I've even been using the remote control! Every feature at your fingertips.

You just get a feeling from it that it is so incredibly well designed and built, like it would outlast you. Worth every penny, imho.

The only downside I can see, and it might not be, is when it goes from fan to cooling ... you can hear a little relay clicking on/off as if it doesn't quite know whether it should turn on or not. Will this have any impact on longevity? I don't know. For now it is working flawlessly.",Approved
Good product but I'm finding it very difficult to purchase additional shelves so not very happy about that.,Approved
"i have recently had this fitted in my new kitchen, having cooked with gas for years it was a delight to use my new electric oven. i found it easy to use, child friendly. it is great to be able to watch my baking rise, no need to keep opening door to inspect progress. would recommend this oven to everyone.",Approved
Excellent large capacity oven. Very stylish and would enhance any kitchen. Many functions which take some getting used too. Several rack placings make cooking a large roast meal easy and it is quick and efficient saving energy. Still getting used to all the options but whether you are cooking a piece of toast or a leg of lamb this oven will do the job!,Approved
Very pleased so far with this washing machine which replaced my previous AEG that lasted 16 years without problems. Hopefully this one will be equally reliable.,Approved
oven seems to work ok so far although i haven't been able to use the sense cook feature yet as instruction book doesn't seem to match the oven.all so this doesn't have a soft close door on this model but was told it did by man in currys.bit annoying as not one in the showroom to look at .,Approved
"The BEB351010W built-in single oven has the build quality I have come to expect from AEG. It is a breeze to install and set up courtesy of the detailed installation and user guides provided. The design is contemporary and minimalist sporting a light blue LED clock/display and hidden soft-release flush fitting controls on the front panel. It cooks evenly and quickly and comes with shelf, trivet and roasting pan accessories with 5 shelf positions. The oven has 9 functions to cover all types of cooking including: True Fan, True Fan PLUS (adds humidity), Pizza, Conventional, Bottom Heat, Defrost, Grilling, Fast Grill and Turbo Grill. The additional Aqua Cleaning feature can also be used to help clean the oven. 2 year guarantee with product registration. Made in Germany. 5 Stars.",Approved
"After 20 years cooking an oil-fired Aga, I don't have that option now I've moved to Spain, I loved the styling, it has a very large viewing window and unfussy, simple design. I already have AEG refrigeration, which I am incredibly happy with, still look amazing after 15 years so choosing AEG was easy. Still getting to grips with the different settings but so far all good and no disasters, cooks food quickly and looks great in my kitchen. I love the grey clock display, just wish it wasn't so bright at night.",Approved
Bought this on looks alone great features no stick out handles or knobs plus self cleaning,Rejected
"Cooks food really well. Once you’ve got your head round all the features, and there’s a lot, it’s so easy to use. Spend the time playing with it and it’s worth it. The auto temp features make it easy to toggle through for speed, and it’s even easy for the husband to use!! I’ve still got to try the bread mode but so far I’m really pleased. Could do with a soft close feature but does not detract from a great product. So pleased that I bought two of them as well!!",Approved
"Even though I haven't had this oven for very long, I'm so pleased that the kitchen planner listened to us for what I needed.
I've never had such a big oven.
My last one was gas and took forever to cook things , but now everything cooks even and the recommended times. Some great features on it too.",Approved
"I read the reviews on the oven before I bought it. It has many cooking options which the booklet explains but not in great detail. I do find it is quite complicated and meal times are stressful when having to flick through the book to find which option to use and if it isn't in the book then good luck. The steam cleaning is good I haven't tried the steambake for baking yet, I have been unsuccessful in making a cake that won't sink after been left to cool, the temperature needs to be slightly lower I guess it is a case of try again. I have been successful with yorkie puds that were huge I was very pleased. The oven looks great and it was a good price.",Approved
"I am delighted with this product and finding out all about the amazing features it has, the safety features, the cooking baking features, so many to choose from, I'm so glad I choose this product, I have already recommended it to some of my friends who are looking to buy an oven.",Approved

"I really liked the look and design so spent most of my time rationalising the cost, as I had previously had an induction cooker, I knew i didn't want anything else.

Easy to use and clean, the hob is like an old friend. I like the clock and lack of knobs no where for grease to hide.

Ovens I love the choice of 2 ovens. First time I have had dual. I like the fact of cooking and temperature not rising for both the hob and ovens and my bill is down. I like the instant control for the hob and the noticeable difference instantly.",Approved
"Beautiful cooker, looks really good in my kitchen. Still learning how all the parts work and agree that booklet is a bit difficult to understand but trying out all the different touch buttons is easier than the book!",Approved
"Brilliant Induction Hob. Love the bridge feature which I use a lot. Also very easy to turn temperature up and down, and that area doesn't seem to get hot (the previous hob did!).",Approved

"After I purchased this shirt I went straight to the skatin' rink, pulled out my rollerblades, and skirted off into the night. It was like magic-- all of the ladies wanted to couples skate with me!",Approved
"I like the amount of suction and carpet lift it achieves. Not under powered like some vacuum cleaners! Reverse spin to unclog brush roller is a clever extra. Has the essential extending pipe for reaching the difficult to reach areas. Has the necessary tools. Not too heavy and looks good too. Only time will tell if the machine stands being lifted and moved around, but so far very good.",Approved

"We was given this product for free from AEG in terms for an honest review.

The product screams out 'quality' inside and out. First off the nice clean look and control panel and stainless steel finish oozes class. Being a pyrolytic oven always appealed to me, and after just doing my first clean after a month of daily use, I must say the results are very impressive. The Pyrolytic Clean function reverted my oven back to like how it was on day one. Absolutely sparkling clean once I wiped the residue from the bottom.

The steam function is a dream. I had never cooked with steam before but to have this option here makes alot of our dishes retain the flavor more and doesn't dry out.

Preheating your oven whilst preparing your foods is so easy with this oven, takes roughly 5-10 mins max to get up to temperature, and then is ready to go straight away. Grill feature allows me to do six slices of toast in one go in a few minutes per side! So much quicker and energy efficient than a toaster!

Everything about this oven again makes me want to cook even more, and makes me want to try new things because of how easy it is to use. Fantastic product.",Approved

"Introduction - this is an addition to our existing AEG oven, which although still great is an older model without many of the advanced functions of this oven.

Installation - we were somewhat worried about whether this oven would fit into a standard kitchen unit due to its additional functionality. However, it turned out to be easier than we expected, with a single electrical connection and the same electrical rating as the previous model. It fits perfectly.

Appearance - as we've come to expect from AEG, this oven looks sleek, modern and stylish. The all-digital controls do away with the need for any protruding controls and as such give a much smarter finish. We know from experience with our older AEG oven that the brushed stainless-steel finish is both fingerprint resistant & very easy to clean. When in standby the display just shows a smart digital clock (which dims at night) and for which the brightness can be changed.

Use - we were somewhat worried about the complexity of a full digital panel, compared with more traditional controls, but this proved to be unfounded. Whilst it does have a huge amount of functionality, all the basic functions are easily accessed and controlled. To turn the fan oven on at 150 C, for example, requires just three presses on the control panel. The menu system is well designed and is easy to navigate.

Use as a normal fan oven - the oven was supplied with one set of telescopic runners - these are new to us and are surprisingly useful - especially if the oven is at a low level. The oven has a quick heat-up option which can be set to operate all the time, and it achieved 0-200 C in 7 mins, which is considerably faster than our previous oven. One of the reasons for choosing this model was its internal capacity, which is better than most on the market - the AEG engineers & designers deserve credit for fitting everything into a standard-sized unit. Using a known accurate thermometer, we checked & confirmed that the set temperature was achieved and remained constant throughout.

Advanced functionality - The oven has a vast array of additional functionality including: normal non-fan cooking, grilling, turbo-grilling, steam cooking, pizza setting, frozen foods, moist fan baking and cooking using the supplied temperature probe (this is excellent btw, allowing you to set the desired internal temperature of meat or fish and giving perfect results every time we've used it - especially good for a large beef joint or a Wellington. It also has many built in recipes - however, one of my criticisms of this oven is that I had to find the details of these recipes on the web - they did not come with the unit, which I feel is an oversight. That said, they do work well. There are even built in recipes based on weight (of the food, not the chef) which is a nice touch. In addition, there is specials menu which includes even more functions such as plate warming, keep food warm, defrost (which works really well, see below), preserving, drying, dough proving (which is a real bonus for us) and slow cooking.

Steam functionality - one of the interesting things with this oven will be building steam cooking into our routine. We initially tested this with defrost, which I was sceptical about, but which worked really well, completely defrosting a 2KG casserole in 100 minutes. A nice touch was that before the end of the programme, the steam stopped so that the oven had dried out before opening it. Cooking with steam keeps food moist and is commonly used in commercial bakeries, so I really welcome this functionality. Water is simply added via a small pop-out drawer on the control panel.

Cleaning - one of the main reasons for choosing this model was that it has pryolytic cleaning. We are used to this with our older oven and wouldn't buy an oven without it. So far, we have only run the shortest cleaning cycle before we used the oven for the first time, but AEG have refined the options by introducing a third setting - you can now choose between Quick, Normal or Intense (1, 1.5 or 3 hours). Also, this model comes with standard ""shiny"" oven shelves which we prefer - the older model has non-stick shelves, which sound great, but which can't go into the dishwasher. In our experience, the pyrolytic cleaning is a life-saver - I love cooking but hate cleaning the oven - with this you just wash the inside of the door, remove the shelves etc and whack it onto clean. Once it's finished and cooled down, you wipe out a bit of ash from the bottom and the whole thing looks like new again.

Cons - overall, we love this oven, but there are a few points that AEG could improve on. Whilst the supplied instruction manual is good and clearly written, it is a little basic. As mentioned previously, it would have been nice to have full details of the pre-programmed recipes supplied with the oven. It would also have been nice to receive some more information on how to use the steam functionality - many people won't be used to cooking with steam and this will be their first foray into a new technology. Accordingly, AEG could consider supplying a recipe book or possibly even a DVD with the oven to show how to get the most from it. 

In conclusion, this oven is highly recommended, simple to use, exceptionally easy to clean & looks lovely. It is more refined than our previous AEG oven - even the beeps when the set temp is reached are less intrusive. There is also a more comprehensive display when cooking, showing time of day, selected settings, time since oven switched on (or to end of programme), whether the oven is heating up or is at temperature. You even have the option to save your favourite programmes under a ""Favourites option"". 

I hope that you find this review useful and I am proud of myself for managing to completely avoid using the word ""knobs"" in an oven review.",Approved

"It has been fantastic to review this AEG steam oven. I have been an aga owner for 5 years and whilst I enjoy the warmth and radiance that the aga offers to my kitchen home., I have missed the ability to cook with precision.
The aeg steam oven allows a precision to cooking. it really is a very cool appliance ! I like the fact that the food seems to me to be cooked very evenly all over and all the way through.
I have still been able to enjoy slow cooking. I have enjoyed slow cooking joints of beef and lamb and am delighted with the succulent results that I have achieved by cooking with this oven. I decided to test out a 'christmas dinner' with the oven in readiness for the festive period. I was delighted with the moistness of the turkey, which is indicative of the qualities of a steam oven, and the very adequate space within the oven to accommodate the ridiculous amount of accompanying foods that we always have christmas.",Approved

"As the title suggests, the steam oven feature is what sold me on this oven. I chose AEG because Whichn says good things about the reliability of the make and the accuracy of the temperature keeping if their ovens.

"I have to point out that I was selected to receive a free product by the manufacturer, in return for a full & frank review of the product.
I previously owned an LG Washer/dryer, so I am quite used to using similar functions on my previous machine, and I was pretty happy with it. I have to say though, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE my AEG WASHER/DRYER!!!
It is so quiet, that I regularly check it to make sure I have remembered to put it on, it really is as quiet as that! We're a household of five....three adults, a teen (almost an adult) & a little one, and I also work from home as a Hairdresser & beauty Therapist, so I do several loads of washing a week!
Its got a huge drum, 9kg, so it enables me to fit quite a lot of washing in at a time (saving me money, which is a huge factor for us with rising fuel costs).
Talking of fuel costs, I'm actually looking forward to seeing what a difference there is in my water & electricity bills, as theres a Super Eco Programme which I regularly use & that is only 2p per wash & saves over 80% on water & energy versus a usual wash!!!! (My water bills are atrocious too) Suffice to say, I use this programme A LOT!!! :)
My stepson is at 6th form & he has to wear suits to school, & my daughter works up London as an Office Manager, so also has lots of business wear....I live in a little village with only a hair salon, a beauty salon & a village shop. The village shop has a dry cleaning service where they send it away & it comes back about 4-5 days later, but its expensive too. I've been using the wool programme to wash all of these instead, & I've saved myself an absolute fortune, and they smell much nicer than when they are dry cleaned too!
One last thing, my hubby is 6ft 3"" so we have Emperor size bedding. I thought I would try the dryer out to dry the bedding, thinking that with it being a washer/dryer that it would struggle to dry it properly, not at all!!! It was dry in less than half the time it took my previous washer/dryer & I didn't have any damp areas left either! I'm chuffed, so so pleased, & I've already recommended this product to two of my friends who are about to have their kitchens remodelled!! I love it, I'm so pleased!!",Approved
"This is the first oven I've ever owned where I'm not having to constantly dig out the user guide to remind myself which is the best setting. This is because the full text menus provided on the oven's screen are excellent. The touch control buttons that are integrated into the glass panel make it easy to keep this oven clean on the outside (no more knobs and button recesses to collect the bits of meal ingredients from sticky fingers!).
Have yet to use all the features but cooking performance so far has been as one would hope with an oven at this price point.",Approved
This an excellent hoover with super pick up & at the flick of the front it cleans the risers on the stairs,Approved
"I have only owned this oven for just under a month...so my review is based on what I have used to date...but so far, I'm impressed. It's easy to use, looks stylish...what more could you ask for...oh I know a thermostat that tells you when your food is cooked, just how you want it....but guess what, it's got that too....Great product would highly recommend.",Approved

"Took us a while to work out settings for different types of cooking - as the instruction booklet is too prescriptive (and over simplistic) about the cooking with different settings - example, it mentions baking on multiple shelves and roasting large joints - not everyone does this, but what about roasting a smaller join as well as potatoes and vegetables at the same time - this is what more people are likely to do........
It is going to take us quite a while before we are confident with the settings (I am an Graduate Engineer by profession - Systems and Software Design for Telecoms, so not normally fazed with operations of appliances).",Approved
A bit bulky for a hand held vac cleaner but works very well,Approved
"Really like the product, the steam option is very useful.
The only issue is the product does not come with a grill pan and you have to grill with the door closed which takes some getting used to !",Approved
"The unit took 24 hours to achieve working temperature, which was a bit disappointing, but has worked well since then. The instructions are not that clear, who needs a built in kitchen timer? Still haven't worked out the fast freeze settings, (when I tried it warmed up and things melted). Simple buttons would be much better. Now it is working I will leave it well alone!! 
Surprisingly small inside for a large unit but probable the same as other similar frost free devices.",Approved
"This oven is like a tardis, it looks like it has average capacity from the outside but when it’s opened up there is so much space. You could easily cook everything you need for a roast in it and still have space! We have two of these ovens as sometimes in our house there are cakes going in one and main meals in the other! The ovens are so quiet you can hardly hear them working which I really like as I’ve never had such a quiet appliance! The features are fab, lots of help on the menu bar at the front and I love the pyrolytic cleaning function! I have used this once so far and it worked really well and the fact the oven tells you when to clean it is quirky too! You also get lots of racks which is quite rare these days! So pleased with them and would recommend!",Approved
When purchasing an oven I looked at loads of reviews of ovens and I was unsure if I would use all the different settings on the AEG oven . I’m so glad that I chose the Aeg because we now use the oven a lot more than we ever did the other ovens . Which means we can cook just about everything from pizza to full cooked chicken dinners. Because of this me and my family are leading a much healthier life style and not having takeaway food .,Approved

"I seem to not be able to find precise information as regarding placement. Literature is too vague and I need a cookbook or itinerary. Have been on websites but none seem to pertain to my oven model. Very disappointed by
your tube advice..all seems to be for top of the range models. I am willing to change my cooking habits regarding shelf levels but you are not giving me enough support when I have spent so much money to install the oven. Will definitely not recommended buying this product unless you seriously address advice to new buyers in form of a cookery book for at least basics.",Approved
good oven but control knows leave a bit to be desired as difficult to see and read. other wise very good oven,Approved
"My old oven was over 14 years old and while it was still working, it was getting dirty and difficult to clean. I had this AEG oven for over a month now and it has been great. Really like the modern and stylish look of it, and the clear view of the inside. It heats up quite quickly (about 4-5 minutes faster than the old one) and is so much quieter. Have not tried steam baking yet but it seems easy to use. I can't wait to try out the Pyrolytic cleaning function.",Approved
"I have not used the steam function and don't know if I ever will. It is too much of a faff. I don't like the count up clock function either when it is in use, and it cannot be turned off. Why not just leave the clock as the default? I bought the oven because it had the largest capacity for a single oven. I hope that it will be a reliable and last a long time.",Approved
"Very light and easy to move around. Small dust compartment but it is easy to clean out.
We like the stand in which to place the vacuum to charge the battery.
The hand held part is really efficient in removing our cat's hairs from the carpets and chairs.",Approved
"Disappointed that there were no instructions enclosed in the box.
More disappointed that I did not get a reply to my email request for instructions.
This leads me to suspect that 'service' is not an AEG strong point.
However thee vacuum works quite well and is easy to use.",Approved
"Lovely oven, steam feature adds to flavour and texture but not sure the extra expense is worth it.",Approved
"Bought this product 2 years with my new kitchen. Had to have an engineer out just after 12 months later as it was constantly running and ice in the bottom of the freezer. Problem fixed at the time but now, another 12 months on I have exactly the same problem. Really not what I was expecting from such an expensive product. Coupled with the bad design - the top drawer is very hard to access because of the overhang of the counter top. Really wouldn't recommend this product and certainly wouldn't recommend.",Approved
"We are still learning to use all the many functions of this superb oven, the probe when roasting, the easy clean function, we haven't had any meals yet that have been 'not quite right' as the menus are there to help guide you. A fabulous oven for the experienced cook and those just starting out.",Approved

"The hob is very fast, easy to clean and I really like the automatic heat up function and the individual zone timers. I’ve found it so easy to swap from a gas hob to this induction one. The top oven is a good size, my baking is successful. Bottom oven automatic timing functions are easy to set and work well. The insulation must be good because the doors are warm to touch, not hot, when the oven is in use, and my kitchen doesn’t get too hot. My little Westie likes to sit in front of the oven door watching the meat roast and licking his lips. This cooker is a joy to use.",Approved
"Brought this induction oven to replace a old ceramic double oven. Wow, what a difference. Virtually instant cooking on the induction hobs with a great deal of control and handy timer to automatically turn off hob when needed. Both ovens cook beautifully even , can't wait to try it out more.",Approved
I am so pleased with this product ...last year I bought a Dyson and (in my opinion) it pales into insignificance with AEG. I totally agree with previous comments I have read when comparisons have been made favouring AEG. I purchased a Dyson just over a year ago and the difficulty of emptying it drove me to get rid ! If your thinking of getting a small vacuum definitely get AEG.,Approved
"Makkelijk in gebruik dankzij het uitschuifbare mondstuk .
Lange werktijd van de batterij.",Rejected
"I use this to vacuum cat litter from our landing and stairs. I find that it easily removes all the liitter as well as all the cat hairs, great.",Approved
Bought for use in car and Motorhome. Very efficient performance with powerful suction and easy to empty. Design marked down because not quite sufficient space to accommodate the very generous mains cable.,Approved
"Nice looking with good features. Oven heats up quickly . Very good bright light so you can see how your bake is doing. Only real issue is that as a baker, I would like another rack between the top and bottom slots in the main oven.",Approved
This is my 3rd cooker this year..had 2 of a different well known thought reliable brand..to find out it wasn't. With finding a replacement we carefully chose this cooker...and what a good choice we made. An attractive reliable and easy to use cooker! I love it! also with a 5 year guarantee includes..very happy customer!,Approved
"Disappointed, might be down to installer / supplier, oven delivered with parts missing, its dangerous to use without the telescopic runners, still awaiting delivery of the missing parts after a week. Also instruction book is poor to use, for example how do you cook a ready meal or use oven with fans without the steam. After spending around £500 a little disappointed. Same with fridge delivered with wrong shelves, could not use for a week, appears to be a quality control at AEG.",Approved
"Excellent features , looks great and right now I can stay really relaxing when I cooked something.",Approved
"Wanted a cleaner for the stairs as I was sick of balancing my Henry on a stair and struggling with the long hose. Originally was going for a cordless but they weren't very strong and the charging was ridiculous.
Then I found this little aeg stair and car vacuum and it ticked the boxes even though it had a cord. I ordered one at a brilliant price and tried it out as soon as it came. And I was amazed at the dirt it picked up on only three stairs. Very easy to use and especially the brush cover that swivels round so you can clean the risers. Bonus ! I'm so pleased I found this little vacuum and would highly recommend it to anyone. Forget cordless , buy this little wonder.",Approved
"Brought specifically to clean the car interior.

The machine has excellent suction and is compact and quite light to handle, the rotating brush cleans car mats with ease whilst the hose allows most awkward places to be reached.

It would greatly benefit from a longer crevice tool and a stiff brush attachment for the hose but you can use the ones of your main vacuum if its an Electrolux or in my case a V*X machine.

In an world of utopia a ""stretchy"" hose would make it a 5 star rating.",Approved
"This is an excellent oven with many practical features and a clean design. It is simple to use despite the features. The one downside is the lack of an oven cleaning facility, so I would recommend you buy the pyrolysis version",Approved
"Purchased this item after searching various reviews for the best corded hand held vac. So pleased with it, well built and designed and with always full suction unlike a cordless one. Great price too for a great product.Will primarily use it for the car but now having seen how good it is will also use it in the home.Would recommend to friends and family 10/10.",Approved
Have had many cookers over the years. Not had one as unsatisfactory as this. I have tried dishes that I have cooked satisfactorily many times in various cheap cookers that have been unsuccessful in this model . I am very dissatisfied. Would change it if not for the expense and hassle,Approved
"Changing from Gas to Electricity takes some gettng used to. I prefer Gas for it's instant heat. I am having to get used the what temperature to cook on, and I have never had a fan oven The first couple of meals were over cooked but I am getting there. My biggest complaint is the step at the front of the shelf which I have to lift anything over and as I have two ovens - one on top of the other - I find it a bit precarious with the top oven.

Overall very pleased with the oven. The extra width is good. The only negative we have found as yet are the control knobs. They are very difficult to see the temperature and feature signs unless you have extremely good light shining directly at them.,Approved
Good grief ovens have changed - how quick and efficient. Bread and cakes bake lovely and I can roast a leg of lamb in an hour. I can see why Which rated this so highly,Approved
Very good better than my last hoover would recommend this,Approved

"Less than a day old and already want it out of my house.The noise is dreadful it just drones on and on and on.Asked for AEG help had no response,very disappointed.Cannot understand why it makes so much noise you should be able to watch tv without this constant racket!!! Will be getting rid of it as soon as it is possible if it doesn't quieten down.",Rejected
"The product is basically very good. It is not too heavy, operates well and small enough for ease of use on a stair carpet. The dust box is small but easy to clean and the filter being small will have to be washed on a regular basis. My only gripe is that the power cable when wrapped around the machine will always unwind itself due to the angle of the cable retainer. All AEG needed to do was provide a small clip on the cable end so the last two loops could be clipped together keeping the wound cable intact. This small error stopped me giving top marks, as the cable issue is very annoying.",Approved
"Freezer fits my requirements perfectly, in size, quality & operation, with simple controls, plus the added benefit of its frost free feature. Very pleased with my purchase.",Approved
"Light strong with very good cleaning performance, good battery life",Approved

"I bought this to replace a Dyson. This vacuum is much better than the Dyson. It picks up all the cat fur (usually empty twice to make sure I don't block up), has a run time of 20 minutes, takes 3 hours to fully charge, as it doesn't have a plug it is very adaptable to clean different areas and the stairs. I would recommend.",Approved
"This is my second purchase of this type of vacuum cleaner. Unlike the previous cleaner, this one has a design fault which could be easily rectified. On pulling the lever to release and empty the waste container the little handle comes off every time which is irritating, fiddly to replace and different to the previous model's fixed plug. It is equally fiddly to attach it again after every emptying. I prefer the earlier model's type of release. The lightness and performance is however good.",Approved

"Good little vacuum for money. Light to use does a good job, the only fault if you can call it that, is the collection box is small, or is it we are just messy and the vacuum has a lot to pick up! Would recommend this vac.",Approved
"The AEG was purchased to keep pet mess at bay between weekly household vacuuming, mainly on hard floors. It has done that job with aplomb and also proved effective around the house for ad-hoc cleaning. The hand tool is very useful on furniture etc. Charging time was offputting but has not proved to be a real problem. Emptying and cleaning the filter is a bit fiddly but, again, manageable. Overall, very satisfactory, especially at the price.",Approved
Once you can get your head around the small finicky dust container and the short 20 minutes usage time this AEG 2-in-1 vacuum cleaner is brilliant. We all have different requirements. Powerful enough to remove dog hair so I'm able to overlook the small dirt container. I just have to clean it regularly. The floor standing charge point is more suitable than a wall designated position. The 20 minutes charge can usually cover my whole one bedroom apartment but you definitely will need to re-charge for any additional hoovering. I purchased a second one at an exceptional price to always have one fully charged. The primary objective is that it is cordless. I'm able to hid them anywhere and use them often. It's lightweight and the manoeuvrablity is normal compared to the all powerful expensive bulky handhelds. This is a sleek stylish quality machine.,Approved
"We purchased this as a second cleaner to our mains powered one, the intention being to use it for small, quick tasks. It works so well and so efficiently that it is now the go to cleaner. The charge lasts for the whole house (7 carpeted rooms and 4 with hard floors). We have two large dogs too. 
The self cleaning brush head is a huge bonus and removes dog hair from the brush very well.
We got this cleaner after returning a similarly priced Vax one that was not up to the task.
All in all very happy!",Approved

Despite the first one delivered being faulty and having to be replaced I am thrilled with my new washer it does everything I require. Great design and a solid well made washer.,Approved
"Efficiently washes,least creases,more programmes including short wash,takes more load than average,spinning noise less than averages.",Approved
"Fantastic vacuum. I suffer from various allergies and after researching, this vacuum was the recommended one. It’s light weight, fantastic suction and the lights on it allow you to see dust in hard to see places. It no longer feels a chore to vacuum as it’s so easy to whip round the house! I also have a dog and the vacuum picks up dog hair brilliantly.",Approved
"This machine is brilliant! Simple and easy to use from the get go. The water collection tray is easy to remove and empty, with the included spout. The design of the machine is nice and the settings cover everything required for a household tumble dryer. It's fairly quiet as well.",Approved
This product has good balance and easy access to all compartments,Approved
It is very easy to use and gets into corners. The charge is adequate and picks up well. We have two dogs and every morning the cleaner is used and any dog hairs on the carpet or hard floors are sucked up. The brush attachment is excellent for the stairs and with just a click the hand held cleaner comes apart from the normal upright standard cleaner. It is easy to empty. We are very happy with our AEG rechargeable vacuum cleaner.,Approved
"I only wish that it had a extendable small hose for furnishing and where you can get into smaller crevices. This is the only thing that I really miss on this new purchase vs my old cleaner.
It is great and space saving!",Approved
This is my second AEG machine. I was impressed with the first machine which is still fully operational but this new model surpasses that,Approved
"The grill as only one setting on or off, could do with been able to turn it down",Approved
"This washing machine is as good as we hoped,Being quieter with a larger drum and more features than our previous machine.We particularly liked the short 20 minute wash also the time shown for other washing programmes.We definitely recommend this machine.",Approved
"This washing machine looks stylish and has an exciting list of features that we have not yet used. Our immediate observation is the long time even a quick lightweight wash takes, in comparison to our old machine, so the weather often changes before it's on the line. We're also very surprised that the £50 cashback offered by AEG on this model takes 4-5 weeks to process so we contacted them about that several weeks ago but haven't yet received a reply!",Approved
"This was bought for my mother, who is 92 years old. It is ideal for her as it light weight and easily moves over her carpets/floors. She is very pleased with the performance of the product and would recommend it to any older person who may have limited mobility.",Approved

"After spending time researching cordless vacuum cleaners, I picked this model from AEG, which had all the features I required. I feel that the cost is a very reasonable, compared to other cordless vacuum cleaners on the market. 
It really is great to use, and I like the following features:
- lightweight and manoeuvrable, yet very powerful suction
- dust spotter head lights are so useful
- rotating brush-head that works great on carpets
- the brush-roll clean technology really works and is the most unique feature 
- replaceable battery, something that is not available in other leading brands
- intelligent charging where the LED lights indicate when charging has completed",Approved
"We had another similar model from AEG prior to this, and that was faulty from day 1, but we were given this unit from AEG to replace it, But, it was only to carry the balance of the warranty from the previous unit, something like 3 months left give or take.

Which in part is understandable, but then you never expect to have varied issues with a brand new unit so soon after getting it, we were given a new filter after the original ones 'twanger' (trigger?) that you pulled to clean the filter snapped off within a week or so of use, they kindly sent another to replace it, and the same thing happened again, I pointed out a difference for our previous unit that is as solid now as the day we got it near 2 years on, but this unit needed 2 replaced in a matter of weeks, so they kindly sent out a newer style which was comparable with the previous unit, but this has also snapped again (after the warranty ended).

Then it passed the end of the warranty time line of the previous unit, and the filter trigger failed yet again, so even though this was maybe 3 months old give or take old in it's own right, the warranty had expired when the previous unit had fulfilled it's timespan, which basically left us with a 2nd unit that was poorly designed (the best way I can describe it given such issues so early on), with even more faults.

Not only has the trigger snapped numerous times (including the replacements we received), it came up with a new fault, this time it was the flexible hose that is connected the head to suck up what the brush produced while Vacuuming, in to the filter that collects the debris as you go round, it gave way (tore?) leaving the debris to be spewed back out before it got to the filter.

So it was making the house dirtier by using it, more so as it was making the debris airborne, I sent a message to AEG about this new fault, knowing it would not result in further help generally speaking, but it would have been nice to have a reply, I was able to wrap masking tape round it so it had some level of being usable, but there is no way of knowing how long it will last.

I would not recommend this to anyone, more so with the wife having allergies, with dust being a factor among them, and she has just had a new allergen test as she was getting worse, only to find there are a load more things that now affect her, we got this (both units) for the ability to step on a button\area that applied pressure to the brush in the form of a blade, that cut any hair tangled on the brush, letting it be Vacuumed up with the rest of it's collected debris, we loved that feature of it, but with the other problems it's pointless, so we will probably bin this as it's got so many issues so early on.",Rejected
"This washing machine is perfect for my needs. My last machine lasted for almost 20 years with no problems, I am hoping this one will last as long.
The difference in the new machine is amazing with the new features, I especially like the 20 minute feature for small washing, the steam works well also, and it is also very quiet.",Approved
"I was a bit apprehensive about buying this cooker. Not being very good with modern technology, I thought it would be difficult to operate. How wrong could I be! It is very user friendly and easy to operate.",Approved
Very efficient oven with many functions. The probe is very good when cooking joints of meat.,Approved
"It works great in an open plan kitchen, especially in an Asian household where the food smell can linger.",Approved
"I've had this iron for just 1 month but I've done quite slot of ironing in that time. I love the design of the iron, the light at the cord base (red when heating, green when up to temperature) I'd great and it heats to temperature very quickly. It has many more steam
Vents/holes thank my last iron which makes ironing a much easier and quicker experience (especially those stubborn creases). The water reservoir is larger than on my old iron so I'm not stopping to refil every few minutes. 
The only 'gripe' I have is that I would like the cord to be longer. I get over this by using an extension lead which is fine, but maybe the designers could include a longer cord on the next design.",Approved
This is the second extractor hood installed in my new home that doesn't work. Works for thirty seconds and then cuts out. We moved in last December and we're still waiting for one that works...really disappointed and not good enough AEG.,Approved
Fantastic piece of kitchen equipment which came extremely well-wrapped. Easy and quiet to operate. First experience of AEG and so far very impressed.,Approved
Only had this equipment a few weeks but impressed how easy it was to fit and looks very neat. Easy change filters and touch controls make it an easy piece of equipment to use and service,Approved
"Immediately could see that the product was faulty. Speed No.1 was very high. Speed 2 was lower and the same as Speed 3. Two engineer visits with new circuit boards and now AEG have confirmed known fault due to incorrect software version in the circuit board. Faulty software is version 7.12. Apparently it needs 7.2.
Product is also much noisier than I expected. Now awaiting 3rd engineer visit with new board with correct software.",Rejected
"Basically it does the job; it gets hot and generates plenty of steam and irons clothes well.
Unfortunately it isn't perfect and falls short of my expectations of German engineering. Here are some minor irritations:
1. The water tank is rather opaque and its quite difficult to see the water level. The first indication of being empty is the noise of the pump running dry.
2. The mechanism designed to keep the water tank attached to the base unit is badly designed. A metal clip is supposed to engage in a slot on the underside of the tank but the slot is too narrow so the clip doesn't engage properly and the tank comes off easily. This appears to be due to the design of the tank rather than a possible plastics moulding defect so I suspect they are all the same.
3. Whenever the iron is switched on it takes a long time to prime the water pump for the steam, I would expect 5 seconds not 35.
Our previous steam generator iron was a Morphy Richards and was much better.",Approved
Very pleased after 3 weeks. Obvious benefits are quietness of the spin and flexibility of adjusting length of program. Not sure yet if the steam function will be used much as it will only benefit a limited range of items which would need sorting after the main wash before starting the steam.,Approved
"Looks Fantastic. Good Features. Bit noisy, but is to be expected with this powerful model.",Approved
"It does what it says on the box! The design is lovely, the colour is exactly what I was looking for too. This product is ideal, great performances and retails at about half the price of other brands. The steam is ready in less than 2min which makes it the perfect tool for everyday or when in a rush.",Approved
It has turned my ironing days into a walk in the park! Very easy to use and delighted I made the choice on AEG which was a recommendation from a friend.,Approved
"Bought on line at an excellent price. Found item had been in storage for years leading to degradation of the elements. All replaced under warranty.

Minor cosmetic damage also dealt with but was surprised to be asked to contribute £80.00 towards labour costs.

After three visits by engineers I now have an exceptional and versatile oven, quick to heat and quick to cool, only lacking a plate warming facility.",Rejected
"The continuous steam feature can be accidentally operated, causing a possible scalding effect.
I have had to tape up this feature to prevent inadvertent operation.
The water holding tank is not removeable, thus the whole appliance has to tipped over to empty the tank.and is cumbersome.
The iron effect is very good and the storage of the flexibles is better than our previous steam generator.",Rejected
Wonderful my kitchen looks cool.can't wait start cooking with my new AEG cooker and hob.My friend will so green with envy.,Approved
"Having been disappointed in the past with cookers, described features and then practical use of them being difficult, this AEG model has been great. Everything seems to work as it should, removing the fittings to clean is an easy task, plus it does not seem to get as dirty as previous ovens did. If there is one drawback, it is the lip on the oven shelves which makes it awkward to remove dishes etc, however there is also the safety aspect to consider and it means dishes cannot just slide off the shelves and spill.",Approved
this is by far the best product that I own it is lightweight has a long run time on the battery. Short recharge time and best of all it is really efficient,Approved
"I always research new purchases before making a decision.
This time however my decision was based on previous knowledge of the kind of quality a company produces.
I have not previously owned a cooker hood, so I looked into things like noise levels and this cooker hood was in a lower category than a lot of others I might have considered.
I have to say, it is very smart in appearance, on its loudest setting, it is not too bad and is quieter than the previous system that I used, it has two lights that are positioned well and looks easy to look after...am very pleased with my purchase , this is my fourth AEG item, what more can I say?",Approved
Has a lot more features than I expected. Good investment.,Approved
Easy controls and very efficient to use with great temperature control,Approved
"We picked this oven because it had the features we wanted, but came in a lot cheaper than the competition. So far so good - it is proving reliable, the food coming out of it is amazing. Makes good pizza too. 
The only problem I have is with the shelves. They are not flat, they have sides, so when you put a tray in, it sits inside the shelf. 
The problem then comes when trying to get the 200 deg C tray out. It is difficult to do without burning yourself on either the tray or the oven. All previous ovens I have owned have flat trays. 
For such a small feature, it has seriously affected my view of this oven",Approved
A very useful pair of ovens; Upper can be used as plate warmer. Useful timer facility.,Approved
This is our move away from a traditional gas cooker and so far it has not disappointed. One poor feature bis that the symbols on the control knobs are not easily viewed at the height of this double oven.,Approved
"The day after the oven was fitted, it was announce that the oven light fitted will be discontinued. This effectively make the oven obsolete once the present bulb blows. I have sent a query to AEG twice and received no reply. 
The corners of both oven doors have sharp corners and are liable to cut if care is not taken.
I would not have bought this oven if I had been aware of this.",Approved
"We chose this AEG cooker for the touch screen display, but also because both ovens have fans. We are very pleased with our purchase and we love it's sleek and modern design.",Approved
Excellent oven but don't remove door to clean as difficult to put back on.,Approved
"I love this oven. Im glad we chose this one. Its so easy to use, and great functions to choose from. I have noticed a difference in how quickly things cook and definitely love the pizza function. No soggy bottoms! The timer and the ability to set a start and finish time is great for busy life and ensures we still eat good food not running for the junk. Really happy, and would absolutely choose AEG for other products too",Approved
"We have been using cooker for about 2 weeks but upto now I can honestly say its the best ever in our house. The Hob is very good easy clean, safe, and very quick at getting going, its an induction hob and very impressed.",Approved
This product is very efficient at picking up larger and smaller bits. I especially like the light that shines on the area in front as you vacuum. The brush cleaner is a touch of genius as my long hair always gets stuck in the brush. Its light weight and easy to use. It is also stylish to look at.,Approved
"The first cooker hood arrived from currys but the corners of the front face plate were like a razor currys were very good but they contacted aeg and the person they spoke to said yes they are sharp and you should always wear gloves.
Stupid statement and currys agread they replaced the unit and all edges smooth so know i would reccomend the hood.",Rejected
"Having only previously used vacuums with cables and hoses, this is a revelation. It's light, portable and powerful and i actually enjoy cleaning with it. The function that chops up tangled hair is pretty nifty too.",Approved
"i brought this aeg 6680 hm it is a great design easy to use and works well,modern styelsit which would grace any kitchen the filters are in a chrome case rather then just a mess type easy to clean in dishwasher",Approved
"This is an Excellent quality product which is both visually stunning and technically brilliant, the induction hob is the most responsive and powerful I’ve ever used, whilst the ovens are spacious easy to clean and cook everything to perfection. I also find the controls simple to use and very well laid out with excellent timer functions on both ovens and the hob this appliance wants for nothing and performs superbly every time!",Approved
Really good cooker. Recommended this product.work 100% like been said!,Approved
"It has been a pleasure in getting this AEG Built In Double Oven. From the help and advise from the staff at John Lewis, to the delivery and assistance with getting up stairs. Installation was straight forward for the Electrician and the oven was working in well under an hour.
The change from knobs to touch icons was a quite a learning curve and our only complaint. The instruction manual is sparse and unclear, it really needs to be beefed up a good bit to help all users. 
That said we have now got the hang of it, just, and have used both ovens for a range of meals, roasts, grills and cakes. It is way ahead of our old oven, more efficient , easier to clean, more functional and good",Rejected
"Amazing product, I had an older model and replaced it with this new one as couldn’t live without it. The hand held vacuum is a bonus. So quick and easy to use",Approved
The control panel is difficult and the pre-programs not necessary. There should be separate buttons for the top oven and bottom oven. The bell is over complicated - a turning button would be easier rather than trying to stop the current button at a particular minute. The bell is not loud enough. The instruction manual is not very good at explaining the control panel.,Approved
"I was unsure about replacing my old double oven, but thank goodness I did. I now realise how much of a battle I had unwittingly had with my old oven. This oven has relevant programs that work, cooks to temperature, warms up quicker than any other oven I've ever used and looks wonderful. It also advises you of the temp on the way up and as it cools down. Brilliant and beautiful. Highly recommended.",Approved
"Our one issue concerns the brightness of the information in the display window. In daylight, if your eyes happen to be looking straight at the display window (that shows oven temperature information etc), it's perfect. But, if you are slightly shorter - and I mean only by an inch or so, then the information is difficult to see. So make sure you are there when the kitchen fitter is doing his stuff and don't let him set it up for his own height, not that it's easy to change anyway but it can be done!",Approved
"I am really pleased and happy with my new oven. I chose AEG after much research because I considered the quality would be of the best. I was not disappointed. On the downside I find that markings on the control knobs are almost impossible to see I am 5ft 6” tall and standing on my tip toes I still cannot see what setting is at the top, also I find the way the shelves are designed with an almost an upside down feel make it somewhat hard to lift a hot and heavy dish over the front edge of the shelf. These last 2 comments are both design points and do not in any way detract from the excellent performance and features of this oven. I am very satisfied",Approved
"the oven and grill I have from aeg is a nice working machine, I picked it because the top oven/grill can be used as a small oven instead of using the large oven for a few items..up to yet its working lovely",Approved
I cannot think of anything this oven cannot do with all the features available. Takes a little while to get used to all the controls but great when you do. Also like the runners that can be inserted to ensure you can slide out your hot dish in perfect safety,Approved
Love my new chimney. The 2 lights are lovely and bright to keep an eye on the hob cooking. I only ever need to use the 1st fan setting as it is quite poweful. The filter is really easy to take out for cleaning. Really pleased with it.,Approved
"although it runs out of water quite quickly, the results are the best we have had up to date.
the cuprinol of irons.",Approved
"I have to iron lots of linen and sheets and as we live in a hard water area I get through quite a few irons, probably about 1 year. I was intending to buy a cordless iron, but then I saw this, it has a filter for our hard water and generates more steam that any other iron I have tried. I was worried that it would be too big for my ironing board but it is fine, I rest can rest the iron on the board and leave the steam generator on a surface next to me as the steam tube is plenty long enough to reach the end of the board. Brilliant product hope it lasts.",Approved
This is the first time we have had an electric oven. The user instruction booklet was very poorly written in that it made assumptions that the user would know. We had to rely on help from our daughter and even she found the booklet confusing. We have had to adopt a trial and error approach which is not the way it should be. When we have managed to do what we planned it worked eventually. Not really good enough.,Approved
Very good oven all the features that we require and an a bargain price too. Particularly like the telecopic runner that came with it and have purchased 2 more sets.,Approved
Double oven means that you are not limited to what you can cook. Good selection of programmes.,Approved
I love this double oven the interior lighting in the ovens was not on the top of my list of must haves but i love it. Easy removable glass in the doors is a must but the spacious ovens with a grill in each oven really steals the show. A simple stylish design the only criticism I have is that due to the height of my oven housing aperture I find it difficult to read the markings on the switch dial but a person slightly taller than my self would not have a problem,Approved
"My oven has burnt the base and is hard to clean, certainly not self cleaning. No handle on grill pan and very slow to heat up.",Approved
"I'm really pleased with our DBB5960HM cooker hood. I love it's contemporary design and the fingerprint free stainless steel. The wireless function is fab (compatible with my induction hob), it just comes on and the fans adjust according to what's cooking. When I'm done I switch off the hob and the cooker hood switches off accordingly. I like to think you pay for what you get and so far so good.",Approved
"Hi, this is a lovely double oven including grill. Works well and is quiet.
I am not sure why it doesn't include a grill pan.",Approved
Smart and clean looking but the dials are almost impossible to read because they are positioned around the dial instead of on the facia. Anyone small would not be able to read them. This is a bad design which was never on previous models. A disappointing purchase. If I had seen it in a shop instead of the internet I would not have bought it.,Approved
Looks good and works well. Very pleased with our new oven.,Approved
"Good oven. Heats up quickly and seems to maintain temperature well and accurately. The visual design is pleasing to the eye. The first issue is with the design of the control knobs. The numbers and oven mode selection is printed onto the knobs with the selection point being at the top. This means unless you are quite tall it is extremely difficult to see. The second issue is with the design of the wire shelves which have a high ridge all the way round, this makes it difficult to take things out of the oven.",Approved
"I have recently switched from a Neff Slide and Hide to this AEG Cooker. The cooker is not as visually stunning as some of the competitors and I do miss the Slide and Hide feature but to be fair AEG's usual door configuration gives the inside of the oven more space. Performance is better than the competitors, I found this cooker heats up quickly and can run far hotter than the competitions models.",Approved
"Its extremely easy to use, lightweight and I love the colour",Approved
"If you want a basic cooker this isn't the one for you, although it doesn't take too long to get used to, just keep the instructions handy.",Approved
"We are really impressed with our new oven, it is a lot more efficient than are previous one. The push in controls are a bonus for ease of cleaning. We would have liked to be able to move the sliding rack rails into the top oven and have tried but they would not fit. We would definitely look to purchase other AEG products in future.",Approved
"I was very impressed with my new built in oven. Very smooth lines and easy to clean. The oven was extremely well built and I hope that it will give me good service for several years. The grill is large , efficient and cooks food evenly.There is only one drawback, however, and that is the symbols for selecting grill or oven type are on the side of the control knobs and can be difficult to read.",Approved
"Having to replace old AEG oven, this has all the facilities we need to cook and have found it to be more efficient",Approved
We built it into Cupboard at eye level as per our previous oven but this made it difficult to see the temperature settings for the ovens but otherwise it is very good.,Approved
"overall were pleased with purchase, however as other reviews have said it is a little slow when using top grill, and the controls are somewhat difficult to make out if your on the small side, but unfortunately not finding it anywhere on display at any retailers you can't judge how difficult its going to be.",Approved
"I have nothing negative to say about this oven. It is so quick and cooks everything evenly. I haven't tried the cleaning function yet, but I imagine it will also work perfectly. Both ovens are an impressive size and I love being able to grill with the door closed. Doing my first lot of baking today and really looking forward to using my oven. Also love the sleek design, it looks amazing. Thanks AEG",Approved
"This has been one of my favorite things in our new kitchen and even the cake that i made last week was according to my husband, ""the best cake i have ever made""! The double oven is large enough to cope with the Sunday lunch onslaught and the different functions make a difference to what you cook from pizza's to lemon and poppy seed drizzle cake!",Approved
"Good specification and simple to use, but the information lacks clarity, there is no mention of how to order replacement filters etc. 
I've had problems where the fan fails to operate, if the unit is tapped and then it starts working. Suspect a faulty switch but again it's difficult to obtain the correct procedure how to sort it.",Approved
Bought the week before Christmas - so easy to use! Having a fan in each oven was the reason for purchase. Both ovens have 1st class features. Christmas lunch for 10 was the easiest ever with the AEG. Can highly recommend.,Approved
I brought this double oven for my new kitchen and couldn't be happier. It's easy to use and looks great.,Approved
"Installation only completed yesterday and we struggled with the user guide which leaves much to be desired. Still trying to fathom it out, I do think it would be good to give at least one step by step guide to cooking something say in the main oven e.g. a roast joint of meat.",Approved
"We have used the oven for a few weeks now and find it cooks very well. The fan oven cooks faster than our 20 year old Neff fan oven and is a bit quieter as well. The only complaint is with the control knobs. These are a push in/push out type with the various settings etched into the barrel of the knob so that they are hidden when in the pushed in (closed) position. Unfortunately these settings are virtually unreadable unless you are about 7 foot tall as the knobs are located above eye height. Being an oven designed to fit into a tall cabinet this seems a bit stupid. OK you can memorise the settings but its clearly not a well thought out design. Form over function, looks good so forget about the userbility.",Approved
"My first double oven and a brilliant addition to my new kitchen. Easy to use, cost effective and elegant.",Approved
Nice design. Looking good and works perfect. Easy to clean.,Approved
Good design all functions easy to apply  quiet and good looking,Approved
"Very pleased. The oven takes approximately 7 minutes to heat from cold to temperatures around 200 C. It then keeps its temperature accurately. Even at high temperatures, the glass in the doors remains cool to the touch. We love all the timer functions and that once the oven has reached the end of the cooking period it automatically starts to cool down quite quickly. In use it has the feel of a quality machine. The only feature we would like that it hasn’t got, is a steam cooking function like some of the built in ovens have. We were also very impressed with how helpful and patient AO were when the original oven that we ordered turned out not to fit into our kitchen units.",Approved
"The product is great looks good and cooks wonderfully even. The temperature controls are easy to use and self explanatory.
There are just two a couple of items I would have liked slightly different.
The minus/stop/plus buttons were not easy to see. I kept pressing above them at first.
The interval timer I use a lot and would have liked that to appear first when the stop button is pressed.
The cook time controls should have applied to top and bottom ovens.
Nothing major that I can't work round but I like to tell it how it is.",Approved
"Does a really good job, all that I expected. I would recommend this product.",Approved
This AEG coocker is the best I ever had consumed less energy less coocking time and really easy to use I would recommend you this magic technology electric cocker.,Approved
Easy to use. Induction hob very quick as good as gas maybe even more responsive. Ovens keep very good temperature one slight problem needs something on hob to stop pans moving when stirring food.,Approved
"Product seems to be good quality, and cooks evenly & quickly. Controls take some getting used to. Grill / oven tray does not come with any handle and furthermore AEG / Electrolux cannot supply one, nor can they advise which of the numerous handles stocked by their spares department will fit, which seems totally bizarre.... Advice received to buy a complete new pan and handle, or a silicone oven glove - odd for an oven costing close to 800 quid...",Rejected

The cooker looks great but has one great annoyance for me. I am female of average height and yet I cannot see the top of the function/temperature knobs. This is where you need to line them up to make sure you are cooking at the correct temperature or even on the right oven function. Poor design and no good to anyone unless you are over 6 feet high!,Approved
The oven reaches temperature quickly and is very quiet. Good selection of cooking modes,Approved
"This is a good value kettle with some excellent and useful features. My only complaint is that with the filling gauge located immediately behind the handle, it is very difficult to see when holding the kettle under a tap to fill it. To place the gauge on the side would be much easier in that respect.
Overall, though, I am pleased with the purchase, but I will wait and see whether it lasts any longer than our previous kettles, of various makes and values, all of which developed leaks after about 2 years.",Approved
My all family members really enjoyed for this product .,Approved
Great clear controls that are easy to use. The oven thermostats seem to be really accurate. Digital read out very clear.,Approved
"It is very small inside. Although this states that it is a 12 place setting, a leaflet that was sent to me from AEG customer service as I did not receive one with the appliance, states it's a 9 place setting.

All my glasses (tumbles# keep falling over when placed in the top basket when pull out the basket to load another item # but customer service has told me these should be put in the lower basket. If I did this there would be much room for my plates & bowls. I have had 4 other dishwashers and they said use the top baskets for glasses).

Can not load baking tins as none the plate holders fold flat to enable these to be put in at an angle. However Customer Service has also told me that pots& pans should not go in a dishwasher

The leaflet that was sent to me to show how to load this dishwasher only shows that you can put in cups, plates bowls & cutlery. So maybe this is what AEG are suggesting.

Due to this, we have to wash up our pots & baking tins by hand. So as we have to do some washing up we might as well do the lot to save on water. Sorry, but I have wasted my money on this appliance.

I feel that with this dishwasher, there no point in having one.",Approved
"I bought this dishwasher as part of my new kitchen from Magnet on the recommendation from the salesman that AEG were the best!
They are not the best; they are the worst.

The dishes are not cleaned properly.
The racks are awful to load
Capacity is poor
Only 3 wash cycle options
Feels cheap, not robust.

I feel cheated!
Both by AEG and Magnet. This is an awful machine, I wish I had kept my old Hotpoint machine and saved my money. This machine is not fit for purpose. Do not buy one!",Rejected
"Both ovens are brilliant and heat up fast. I love the feature where it beeps when the oven is up to temperature. Controls are easy to use, and the oven looks great in the kitchen. Stunning bit of kit and would 100% buy it again.",Approved
The unit leaks after 2 years and has been deemed beyond economical repair. Would not recommend this product to anyone. Surely a dishwasher should last for more than 30 months?,Approved
Nice Design and Powerful. Takes every Hair away. Runs about 15 Minutes on highest Lower level. Also nice is the LED Lights. I would buy again this Item,Approved
"We have replaced our other AEG dishwasher that was 8 years old with this one, and really wish I hadn't bothered.
It washes the pots ok, like any dishwasher should, so no brownie points for that one, but, if you look at the programme times, they are APPALLING.
There is just no need for a main wash cycle to take 3 hours, yes THREE hours!!
If you have a busy life style like us, and have to leave the dishwasher for a while after it has finished a cycle, then DONT!!!!!!
If you do, your pots will need to be dried before you can put them away, as for some reason, they seem to get covered in condensation, and this NEVER happened on my old one.
And here's the nightmare bit.............
When you try and load the bottom basket you will need someone to help.
You need someone to hold the bottom basket out while you load it, because it just slides straight back in.
It will NOT stay out, and this is so annoying while trying to load, and guess what ?.......yep.....old one didn't do that either.
So, AEG fan or not, I would advise you give this one a VERY wide berth.
NOT fit for purpose !!!!

"I cannot write a proper review, because the cowards at AEG will not let me, as they don't want me to give any bad publicity !!!!!",Rejected
"Great double oven both top and bottom fan assisted.
Controls take a bit of getting used to but easy once you master them, user manual is poor and doesn’t cover the basics.
Oven shelves are a bit flimsy compared to old oven but telescopic runners are good and have a stop to prevent shelf hitting back of oven, the standard shelf however has no stop and can be pushed back too far restricting the fan flow.
Glass doors stay cool even after hours of cooking which is good if you have children.
Overall a very good oven and I would recommend.",Approved
I bought this for my wife to use as she was struggling with a bad back using a cylinder type cleaner. She absolutely loves it. It is so light and manoeuvrable that her back is starting to recover. Faultless so far.,Approved
Our first one was faulty but once this was replaced we have enjoyed using our new dishwasher. Lots of options on each wash and the design/layout is much better than my old machine. Means I fit more items in and they are washed better too. The fact that it all looks rather smart is a added bonus. Over all happy with my purchase.,Approved
"Love this oven, all electronic but very easy to understand and operate. Constant information feed is fabulous as you know exactly what is happening all of the time.
Both ovens fan assisted which is great for those large party lunches and dinners - bring on Christmas!",Approved
Purchased an ex display model without user manual. Your support team have emailed instructions for similar models as this one isn't available online yet ! Everything great except haven't worked out yet how to use the grill without the fan oven !,Approved
"My new AEG DCE731110M was installed today. It seems to be fine except for one major problem - if you are using both ovens, it does not seem to be possible to turn off one oven and leave the other operating. You have to turn off the whole appliance, and turn the oven you want to keep using back on again. Thiere may be a way around this but the AEG Contact link on the website does not work so I can't ask  AEG Customer Service.",Approved
We are enjoying our new cooker but the hob surface seems very easily marked.,Approved
"I love the look of this cooker in my kitchen. It is easy to use and very responsive. Food cooks beautifully, it heats up very quickly but then needs lower temperatures to cook well and the oven! Superb! Using the food probe for meat wow! Soft succulent and soooo tasty. I love the bridging feature if you need more pans on the hob and the stop and go is so handy if the door bell or phone rings. Cleaning the hob is a quick wipe. Don’t know why I didn’t buy it sooner.",Approved
This cooker looks very good in my kitchen and overall I am pleased with it. Cons.. no handle on grill pan. Controls are hard to get used to.,Approved
"I’ve had an induction hob in the past so wasn’t sure how this induction cooker would compare...I have been pleasantly surprised. It looks good and though it took me a little while to work out all the touch icons, once you know it’s easy. A joy to cook on and the ovens being of a good size and two of them, saves me a lot of time. I knew the induction was easy to clean and this is no exception. I have no regrets in having spent the extra for a cooker that looks expensive and worth every penny.",Approved
"Looks great, cooks great, makes a fantastic new kitchen extra special, everyone comments on how good it looks.",Approved
"I am very pleased with this dishwasher. I particularly like the way the bottom tray lifts up when pulled out, it makes it very easy to load. I do find the clips on the middle tray a bit bit fiddly to use. I presume they are meant to support long stem glasses but there is not really enough room for them underneath the cutlery tray. I have bought a separate AEG glasses container which can be loaded with glasses and dropped into the bottom tray where there is plenty up height for them. I do particularly like the cutlery tray and is a great feature. I wasn't sure about the fact that the door pops open when the cycle finishes but in fact it works very well to aid the drying process.",Approved
Good power for a rechargeable stick vaccum cleaner. Glides well but has difficulty picking up close to the edges but tool comes on handy.,Approved
"After careful investigation and deep research, we decide to buy this dishwasher.  Advertising was amazing, also as pictures. The reality was is not what you expect from the machine for 700+.  Quality of baskets is same as Bosh or Grundig midrange. The door is floppy and feels like hinges are broken. But the seal is tight so no real issue with this. The display is informative and responsive.  But you can't choose option or programme with a single button. You need sequence pressing until you reach what you need. Again not a big issue, but we are talking about the top of the range model, it should have the proper menu selector. There no CHILD LOCK, this is annoying. Quality of wash is superior, dishes and pans are washed clean with no residue or any leftovers in it.  With full load machine done amazing, every single corner was reached and cleaned.  But 30 min program is designed only for light soil and only ""fresh"" dirt (wash your dishes straight after you ate your food). ECO programme is same as auto, with a difference in drying. It dries your dishes naturally, by an opening door. and no any heat or vent inside.  Finally, one of most important parts of the review. Machine stopped working within the first week of use (about 5-7 loads). After a phone call to Electrolux service (electrolux=AEG)  been told I need to wait a week for an engineer,  And again after 3 days of waiting Engineer told me that there will be a delay for another week until someone comes over to assess the NEW faulty item. So I believe it may take up to 4-5 weeks until it will be fixed ( there always need order parts).",Rejected
as i have never owned a dishwasher before its taking me a while to learn how to stack and what program to set it to so crockery is clean but doesnt take hours to complete its cycle,Approved
It does it’s job very well as everything comes out sparkling! It has a modern look to its design. The salt chamber is awkward to fill. The controls could be a little more straightforward but after some practice it’s easy enough. Fairly quiet to run. Overall very pleased with my purchase,Approved
"Great features the only thing disappointing is the position of the cooking temperatures on the side of the knobs for both ovens, I have to stand on tip toe to set them",Approved
"Great looking cooker and due to the ceramic cooking surface and touch controls very easy to keep clean.
The child lock is a good idea although we inadvertently switched it on and had to read the manual to find out how to switch it off!
Haven't used all the features yet but will work our way through them.",Approved
This dishwasher is the 1st one I’ve had that takes and washes our extra large dinner plates and bowls!! Very quiet and efficient too.,Approved
"This product is very handy & easy to use, however, the suction is not very good",Approved
"Good quality product, lots of storage capacity in fridge is what we were looking for. Appliance could be enhanced if freezer had separate temperature control",Approved
Used to gas but this is so much easier to use and it looks great too. Seems daunting at first but quickly got the hang of it. A quality item I am sure.,Approved
"This dishwasher worked for exactly 3 weeks before it simply died.
It has no power, no display, nothing at all.
If you try to make a claim on the AEG website there is nowhere to actually find out how to make a claim or get a technician to look at it!",Rejected
I am really impressed with this dish washer. It is amazingly quiet. I do wish it had a floor light to let me know whether its running or finished the program. I would have also liked a cutlery tray rather than basket. It still doesn't detract from being excellent value for money.,Approved
Oven has a faulty Heat Up Indicator and the only thing AEG suggest is using an oven thermometer or leaving it on for 15 mins to heat up ( and then guess the temp) This is a brand new cooker costing £989. I am very unhappy at AEG response,Approved
"This is the worst dishwasher I have ever used, the bottom drawer doesn't roll properly, and everything you put in the top or bottom just falls over. Really regret owning this.",Approved
It really has to be the best cooker in the market it cooker everything the way it shoukd be and it thise not take longe it takes less time to cooke stuff I really recommend this cooke to any one who is looking to by one.,Approved
"Like the cooker, disappointed because it has no timer to set the main oven",Approved
"Bought this cooker to replace old one. Everything about this cooker it’s great a specialy the hob, good quality materials. Two ovens and one grill in top one is so handy, makes cooking for the family much easier. Overall good product but one thing is missing (for me) light to show when ovens reached required temperature.",Approved
"Planning a total kitchen remodel is a bit of a nightmare, so I did a lot of research into choosing the right white goods to put in there.
Having purchased an AEG cooker previously, I was sad to see it go as it was excellent, however, this time I wanted an inbuilt double oven....it was an easy choice to make....this double oven is so easy to use, it has separate controls for each oven that can be pushed flat to the surface of the fascia for neatness....the bottom oven is fan assisted and the doors have a nice solid feel to them.
Although my kitchen has only been up and running for about a week now, I have used both ovens and am very pleased with my purchases, looking forward to doing lots of cooking.",Approved
Had to purchase rubber spikes as glasses and mugs would NOT stand or stay put. Glasses constantly left with residue even on hottest wash. Feels cheaply made and wash cycles are either really long or 30mins! Pipework at back goes straight out no bend on it so didn’t fit well into gap that previously had a deeper dishwasher in! Sadly not impressed. Bought it as had bought an AEG washing machine last year and was happy but this is a BIG letdown. Will go back to NEFF sadly! Would not recommend sadly or buy AEG again!,Approved
You can set the wash programme to start in up to 24 hours enabling you to use your time efficiently without worrying about your laundry!,Rejected
"We bought the AEG dishwasher to replace the old one that was in place when we bought the house and are so glad we chose it.
Our old machine had got quite noisy and was less efficient at cleaning than a while back.
When it finally ‘conked-out’ my wife decided that we must have an AEG because she was so pleased with our AEG washing machine and Tumble Dryer.
We still have our 2 children at home and the machine is perfect for our family of four.",Approved
"As the person usually landed with the washing up our new dishwasher is a great addition to our family home. It is super quiet and even on the economy wash, does a fab job of the dishes. My only comp!aint was that the fitting of it was not particularly easy, especially with the integrated door. If aeg could figure a way to get children to load their dishes into it, it would be perfect!!!",Approved
"This product has eco friendly settings, which are efficient and wash/dry well. Quiet when working and alerts you when cycle is finished. Pots, plates, cutlery and glasses all come out sparkling",Approved
"Dishwasher is 6 months old, and had engineers come 3 different times- say three different faults- not consistent on what was wrong with it. Its been not month and waiting. AEG customer service, still would not offer an exchange. They expect me to just wait for engineers to come and go- order wrong parts and wait until they attempt to ""repair"" it. Keep in mind- each engineer wonders why that ""wrong"" part was ordered. Worst possible service ever.",Rejected
The size of the machine is impressive and very well designed. The machine is very quiet during operation and cleans extremely well. The cutlery rack is a winner!!,Approved
"The cordless cleaner is ideal for anyone who finds weight and flexibility an issue as it is so light and so flexible. It is used in a 3 bedroomed house with a large hall and living room. With one charge it handles all of the house because without a cord you are able to zip round in no time. THe powered brush when used with the detachable vacuum looks like a mini vacuum that makes really light work of the stairs. This feature alone is superb! The amount of dirt, dust, hairs and small general household waste it can pick up is remarkable. Charging is usually under 3 hours and it stores neatly on the dedicated charging station. It is so easty to get out to do odd pieces of vacuuming when required. A most excellent product and worth the money.",Approved
"When I ordered this oven from Howdens along with my new fitted kitchen I foolishly failed to look at the dimensions and, although for most of the year the size of the oven is perfect, I am wondering how I am going to cook a turkey at Christmas as there is no way one will fit in either oven. Apart from that I am happy with my purchase.",Rejected
"After using our old Bosch dishwasher , this is in a different class.
It is well designed, super quiet , large capacity and leaves everything clean and dry.",Approved
"It is light and easy to use I can do the whole house on one charge, it is nearly as good as my old (well known make) cleaner but so much lighter. The only thing I find hard to do is emptying the dust container, I bought a 1 inch paint brush that cleans the filters and the collection box, that makes it easy and I would recommend supplying one as an accessory.",Approved
"Overall I am pleased with this oven, seems to cook various dishes well but am still getting used to it. The bad points - dont like the shelves as the design makes it difficult to remove some dishes and have burned myself when doing so. Also dont like the way the shelves slide right to the back of the oven especially in the main fan oven as dishes could cover the fan! Another dislike is the instruction book the info in here is poor as hardly any instructions relate to the fan oven. Most of the instructions relate to the top conventional oven!",Approved
Purchased this dishwasher with my new kitchen although I picked all the other new appliances I left the dishwasher to the kitchen company and I couldn't be more pleased with it. I like the 30 minute program option which gives a nice clean finish. Also love the fact that when the program is finished the machine door opens so it can cool down inside then switches off (not leaving it on all night like my last one). It is very quite too. Would recommend this dishwasher to anybody thinking of purchasing one.,Approved
"Dishes and cutlery come out sparkling clean and dry thanks to the opening door feature. Rinse programme is also useful.
Build quality is about the same as our old Electrolux. Baskets are flimsy but work OK. Noise level is not whisper quiet, but good enough.
Ikea style installation instructions are too small and do not work with something this complex. Why no dimensions for fitting hardware to the decor door? It's a standard door, surely! Trial and error was the only way to do it.
Good but not outstanding.",Approved
"Good dishwasher overall, While the cutlery tray could be fiddly to use, once you get used to it works pretty well. Personally I miss my cutlery basket  but time has moved on and there is more space for pans. Good support for wine glasses. But we use the WM only a few times a week.",Approved
"What a stunning double oven, it looks superb. We like the clean lines, the anti fingerprint stainless finish. We didn't realise there was a grill facility in the bottom cavity. We have not had to use the catalytic liner cleaning as yet, we always give the cavity a wipe out after each use. Two minor criticisms however. 1 The light in the top cavity is positioned too low and makes it difficult to view anything under the grill if it on the top rack. 2 The grill elements are unmatched, the outer loop glows red nicely, but the inner loop barely glows. Other than these small design failings, this is a great double oven and we can rate it highly.",Approved
We bought this to replace a similar AEG oven of some 15 years old in which the top oven fan had packed up. The process of replacement was relatively easy in putting new base and side plates on although they supplied these new star-shaped/tamper-proof screws for which I didn't have an attachment so I used similar posi-drive equivalents. The major problem I had was that the depth of the unit was slightly deeper than previous which also had a sloping back panel to allow routing of gas pipework for the hob above. So I had to get some pipework changes at the back to allow it to fully sit in the recess. We used both ovens to cook the turkey and veg (a large crown easily fits into the top oven which is slightly smaller than bottom) and had excellent results with cooking and accuracy of temperature. The ovens heat up much quicker than before and distribute heat much better (even when the fans were working!). All in all very pleased with the purchase.,Approved
"Bought this when renewing our kitchen. Programmes are limited and it has no 30 minute cycle for short washing. The minimum wash seems to be over 2+ hours. It has a 15 minute rinse cycle but that’s all. Overall, wish we had shopped around to check programme lengths before purchasing. I wouldn’t buy this specific model again.",Approved
"Very easy to use, with a time saving quick warm up feature. Cooks very evenly, a first cake came out perfectly.
Touch controls seemed daunting initially, but very simple in reality.",Approved
"This is the only double oven I could find that would fit into a ‘build under’ cavity where BOTH ovens were fully functioning multi-tasking cavities, essential for family cooking. It’s early days and there are a few Derr! moments but overall I am very impressed with this appliance’s versatility and quality. Now if someone could please tell me how to turn off one oven without turning off both I’d be happy.",Approved
"I love this lightweight vacuum cleaner. It's powerful, as well as easy to manoeuvre and empty. The handheld vac unclips easily from the long handle and can then be used alone, or with the crevice tool, small brush or animal hair attachment. It works better than my old Dyson Animal and my Henry Hoover, to the extent that I hardly use a full size cleaner any more. The battery lasts well - I have yet to exhaust it , as I usually whip round the main living areas in half an hour. The light at the front of the main cleaner head is very handy for seeing into darker corners as you go. On top of that, I think it looks well-made and stylish. What more could you want? Well worth the price tag.",Approved
This is the first electric oven I have owned and I am very pleased with it it's easy to use and cooks lovely so pleased I made the correct choice,Approved
We have gone from a Bosch which is robust and quality. This machine came 'free' with our new kitchen and although it cleans well it is difficult to stack bowls and glasses. The drawers feel flimsy and roll back into the main body too easily. There is only one option for the delay timer. I do like the design feature where the door opens enabling the contents to dry properly. Wouldn't buy another one.,Approved
"Still no joy , brand new appliance not repaired after 3 visits by service force.has been installed for 2 months and not been apple to wash anything properly.
Have to wait over a week between each visit and the support is poor",Rejected
"Happy with size and layout. Features are very easy to understand and use. Very quiet running and auto drying feature is actually very impressive.
We had a fault develop on door switch after 4 months of use leaving it unable to start a cycle which was annoying. But the repair was carried out swiftly and at no charge under the warranty so still very happy!",Approved
"I purchased this dishwasher to replace my 10 year old Bosh dishwasher, what a big mistake. Although they are both the same size, the interior design of the dishwasher is dreadful, it is so difficult to pack. Nothing seems to fit, as a result things get put in anyway that you can, meaning it holds about half of what my old dishwasher did. As for the door automatically popping open at the end of the cycle and steaming up the kitchen, what is the purpose of that?",Approved
"Really disappointed with this product. Within 1 week of use the door catch broke - bad design. Contacted service department who came out following working day. As this is a new model the broken parts are not available and 5 weeks on we are still waiting for the unit to be repaired. 

Not the sort of service we would expect from AEG.

If this is not sorted within the next week I will be contacting AEG to replace our dishwasher with a new one as this one is not fit for purpose.

I cannot rate the dishwasher's usage as we haven't used it long enough to comment!!",Rejected
"Bought this dishwasher as part of a kitchen refit. Went for the integrated look and have to say that absolutely delighted with it. It has a range of programmes but the shortest 30"" programme does the job on a full load from a family Sunday roast.",Approved
Love this dishwasher. Particularly love the time remaining feature.,Approved
Excellent hoover. Very pleased with it so easy to use,Approved
"As a long-time brand devotee, I am happy that I've once again chosen AEG. They've improved their basket design compared to the previous models, and the flex-grips for tall stem glasses and easily adjustable height of the baskets make it very versatile. The quality of wash is simply outstanding - all my dishes, from casseroles to crystal - come out sparklingly clean.",Approved
"this appliance replaced one of two 'Dish Drawers' We never imagined it possible to see such an improvement in everything we washed - glasses renovated, plates sparkling, pans that look like new. It is a dream to use, quiet, huge volume and we couldn't rate it more highly. Wish we had done this years ago..........",Approved
The product is really quiet and has lots of features and settings to use. Even though it's slimline it can still hold lots.,Approved
"This small dishwasher is excellent at cleaning, even in ECO mode. It has removed tea stains far better than every previous machine and of course is very economical to run. The time light on the floor is useful and the fact it opens to aid drying also a great feature.",Approved
A good quality machine with a wide range of programming options. Cleaning results are generally very good but variable results with cutlery - my cutlery doesn’t fit the cutlery holder lid holes.,Approved
If you dont need or dont have the room for s full size dish washer this is sn ideal choice it has everyfhing you need on it and is easy to use.,Approved
"AEG dishwasher is operating and cleaning pots. Useful program options.
Unable to say any more due to T&Cs",Approved
"Bought the comfort lift dishwasher recently as I have a back problem. Great product but whilst the lower rack that has the comfort lift and works brilliantly on the actual lift, I have found on lowering, it is on the stiff side but it may be me not getting the hang of it. The cutlery tray which is positioned at the top is very good, no bending down for the basket. Downside - can't find a programme which actually says a half load so presume the 30 minute one is it! There is an other programme which autos senses the actual amount of dishes that have been loaded up and is supposed to cut the length of the time but haven't found that it does. Overall, this is a really great dishwasher, expensive, yes, but worth it if you do have a back problem. In my opinion definitely worth the money.",Approved
User friendly external touch screen panel and efficient thick freezer walls.,Approved
"This extractor hood is efficient and quiet. Looks good in black glass, fits at an angle over the hob. 3 speeds, efficient even on the lowest speed and built in lights.",Approved
Takes away all the unwanted steam from cooking effectively with little effort.,Approved
Still waiting for it to be installed into a new kitchen,Approved
"This AEG washer is absolutely brilliant, I have washed everything (without scrubbing.rinsing) from overnight crockery, pots & pans, cooker hood filters, hob grills, and they have all come out clean. After cycle complete the door even opens automatically to air dry and switches off so you don't have to reenter the kitchen! Very impressed. Very good value and would thoroughly recommend.",Approved
"I own a few AEG products and very pleased with them, so I brought this dishwasher, works ok, quiet and does the job, but I find the draws badly designed with wasted space and difficult to load.
Previous German dishwasher better designed.",Approved
does what you want it to do and looks good looks stylish works well,Approved
I am enjoying using the extractor fan. It looks good and performs well.,Approved
"I bought this to replace a more upmarket AEG model that had passed its sell by date. The previous one had more of a clunk to the door closing compared to a boing for this one. Having said that I am sure the new model is more energy efficient and uses less water, so worth having. I like the door popping open at the end of the cycle which really dries the dishes well. This one has a red light shining on the floor when in operation; the old machine actually projected the remaining minutes ... but then I suppose you don't actually need to know that! Overall, the machine works well. We just use the 30 minute cycle and its great. Done before you know it.",Approved
"Features I had put fair because you had advertise the product can be switched on when the hob is on, not told it can on,y be switched on with an AEG hon",Approved
"Once installed this is a great dishwasher. However we found it very difficult to attach the door and the screws supplied were not long enough to hold the door, we had to improvise. It is a good job that we are friends with a kitchen fitter! The performance of the dishwasher is very good. Everything comes out extremely clean. I love the air dry function and the auto stop is brilliant, you can leave the appliance running with the added security it will switch itself off once complete. I give it 5 stars because I think it is typical of AEG quality - our last dishwasher was an AEG and it worked perfectly for 13 years, here is hoping that this one will be just as good.",Approved
I am very happy with the wash quality. I particularly wanted easy access. The bottom tray lifts which I find useful as there is no twisting of my lower back. I also find the “mug drawer” is easier to access at the back than my old machine. The arrangement of thicker knife handles in the top cutlery tray required a little bit of thought.,Approved
"WORKS FINE, FUNCTIONAL AND GOOD LOOKING. NO PROBLEMS.",Approved
"Overall this is a good dishwasher however within several weeks of light use the cutlery tray was faulty , the prongs started to snap off , it was quite a hassle to get to the right department as still under warranty still waiting for replacement cutlery tray nearly 2 weeks later",Rejected
"It has a stylish, glossy and modern appearance, which is different from traditional hoods. It operates automatically during the cooking process, thus leaving the kitchen in an odourless environment. It has powerful suction and ventilation capacity.",Approved
Happy with the product and additional features that this has over my machine it has replaced,Approved
My dishwasher has great features and is very quiet. I am impressed with it. I usually only need to use the 1 setting. I love the lift up bottom drawer and removable cutlery tray.,Approved
Great quality we wanted a dishwasher with stronger baskets and this delivers. The rising lower basket makes loading and unloading the machine much more convenient. The machine is super quiet. Results have all been as expected. I would recommend this product.,Approved
"Got this model to replace an existing AEG dishwasher that had packed up after 17years 
Not disappointed the new machine is far superior. Love the short 30min programme. So convenient and didn't think it would clean the pots in such a short time but so efficient we find we are using it the majority of the time.",Approved
"Good all rounder, could do with a short quick programme but other than that it has been good",Approved
we love the air dry feature which means little or no condensation on plastic articles in the dishwasher and the clean is first rate!,Approved
"Please forget the rest , and go for the best absolutely delighted",Approved
First AEG appliance that we have used and we are very impressed. Like the feature where the door pops open once the dishwasher has finished.,Approved
"Great for multi-purpose induction and gas. The gas is perfect for a wok and the extra trivet holds a traditional wok perfectly with no slipping.
The 4 induction rings are fast and easy to clean.",Approved
The interior of the AEG Dishwasher is the most functional I have ever experienced. The lift out basket in the bottom is superb and work effortlessly. You can fit more crockery/cutlery in this machine than any other I have had and it does not effect the cleaning. Immaculate dishes every time and the dishwasher is so quiet it is even in our kitchen/family room and we don’t here it. Highly recommend,Approved
"A well made and quality dishwasher. The comfort lift basket is excellent, and the cutlery drawer is good.  I haven't found it a problem filling the salt container, and the beam in the floor is very useful, especially as the machine is so quiet.  I really like the air dry function too.",Approved
"The comfort lift tray is a great asset, no more grovelling to get the last plates out of the back of the dishwasher.  The removable cutlery tray is also a bonus, my previous dishwasher had a cutlery tray but to be able to take it to the cutlery draw to empty is great.  Well done AEG.",Approved
"Had the dishwasher in for a week and it is great. I have always had AEG products and the never fail to deliver. This product is quite, dished come out very clean and easy to use. The features including the lifting middle basket really make a difference.",Approved
"This is one of the best dishwashers we’ve ever had, the cleaning is totally excellent, the wash time is also excellent . The only negatives are that mugs don’t quite dry and we are still working on loading the cutlery!! Overall I think it’s an excellent buy and I’d recommend it.",Approved
"Brought this due to the noise level and bottom drawer facility. Top cutlery tray does not allow you to use both sides due to the thickness of cutlery, would only work if your cutlery is super slim. Thought this would be ample for my family of five due to the place settings but due to the way it stacks it is not great and I have to put two loads in to accommodate pots and pans and did not need to with any of my previous dishwashers. Due the door automatically opening to finish drying makes it quite tough to should the door. Takes nearly three hours for a normal wash cycle, the 30 minute wash cycle really only rinses and leaves everything soaking wet, which defeats the object of a dishwasher.",Approved
"This is a great cleaner. Bought it to supplement my corded cleaner but its so powerful I now use it as my main vacuum. Battery life is fantastic, I could clean my house twice on one charge. Its so light and always ready for use that I find I vacuum more often. All the other featurs like brush roll clean and variable power are a valuable extra.",Approved
"I have never used an induction hob before, so when I found this combination i was very happy. I read a lot of posts in various forums about induction hobs, a lot of it was misinformation. This hob does everything you need to do; in my opinion, it is better for browning meat than a gas hob because the pan base gives much more heat through the bottom of the pan without the sides getting hot. I also find the controls very easy to use. I don't use a wok very much at all, but we have the wok burner just in case.
What could it do better? Well, it's a shame that it doesn't have a multi-zone induction area covering the complete area, which senses the pans. Also, the controls aren't quite progressive enough for slow cooking or bringing to the boil, so if you cook below 100 degrees then it's very fiddly to maintain a temperature. Similarly, the heat supply seems to jump very quickly above a setting of 10.
I would definitely recommend this, and I'd never go back to a gas cooker.",Approved
"Lovely cooker but instructions are bit daunting, but I found by using the cooker I’m leaning more",Approved
"Fine design easy to clean and compared with many other hobs pans sit safely on the cast iron top grid without toppling and can be moved around with ease and little fear of toppling over. 
An indication of heat level after the gas is turned off would be a beneficial safety factor.",Approved
"Its a Nice Quality Build easy to use and does a thorough clean job even on a 30min cycle.

Job done!",Approved
"Great dishwasher, easy to use and the indicator light when running is fab",Approved
Love the comfort lift.  Still experimenting with best place for large plates. Love the flexibility of collapsing racks to create more space. Cleaning performance is good. My main issue is with the instruction manual. A one page laminated go to  simplified “Pick a Programme” sheet would be very useful. It was a considerable investment and so far very happy with performance.,Approved
Temperatures are more accurate than previous cookers.Easier to keep clean.,Approved
"We purchased this cooker to replace a previous AEG Competence model. This one took a little getting used to after the last one , but once we had worked out the various controls we are very pleased with the result. The cooker heats up so much faster than our old one and the safety warning lights are excellent. I would recommend this cooker",Approved
"The rubber buffer under the pan grids needs replacement often costing £2each small piece, or £32 for the all four burners; plus postage.",Approved
"This hob replaced one which was too small to get anything more that 4 milk pans on and was unsafe because things would fall off, the AEG hob fixed both of these problems. It has space to move pans around without the fear of them falling off and there is plenty of space to cook even the most complex of meals. I like the red lights indicating a ring is on and for a gas hob this is quite easy to clean plus the 4KW burner is powerful enough to do some serious wokking.",Approved
"Delighted with my new hob and feel the pot stands are a good design , not too heavy looking but much safer than my previous hob which had individual stands for each burner. Would certinly recommend this hob.",Approved
"Looks really good in our new kitchen.
Very pleased with it.",Approved
Very happy with this cordless vacuum. So light and easy to use. Also very quiet. Use every day.,Approved
"Researched hobs for months. This is a sleek low hob with the large ring in the middle. Fits 5 pans easily. Very sensitive controls and easy to clean. Cannot recommend it enough. Expensive, but well worth it for it's look and performance.",Approved
"What a great cleaner, we use it every day and with our 2 dogs its a godsend.
I would Highly recommend this First Class 5 Star machine",Approved
This oven is so easy to use and I am glad to be owning this oven. I find it is energy efficient too.,Approved

"Great for control of cooking, fast and efficient better control of managing cooking procedures. Easy to keep clean.",Approved
Very good looking iron which heats up in less than 30 seconds & irons well. Water tank is clear so the level to check is very easy. Easily stands in between ironing for the base is well sized. The only criticism is lack of steam volume control.,Approved
Very happy with the product. Easy to use. Good temperature control. Fairly quiet. Good spin.,Approved
"Had the dishwasher 4 months. Works great and always get a perfectly clean and dry finish. It’s quiet, and door springs open when it’s finished. I was wondering what the ‘bang’ was during the night, for a few weeks :)  

The door is attached to a slider so you don’t need a cut out space in the kickboard. 

I’d developed a loud creaking noise when the door is opened or closed, but AEG sent RSL respond services who quickly and immediately replaced a part and fixed the issue. Very impressed with the speedy professional service, and all covered under warranty.

My only criticism is that all of my glasses fall over every time the tray is opened, until it’s full. Poor design in this respect, and this is with glasses of all sizes... they just don’t have anyway of sitting in a steady flat position.  For that reason alone, I wouldn’t recommend this product but if they could change the tray so it’s  suitable for glasses, it would be great.",Approved
Modern and very excellent to use.Could have put more features to be honest.,Approved
It looks good set into the island with an aeg hood above.The design makes cleaning a breeze.The contol knobs are far enough away from flame not to get hot.Saefty feature on burners excellent.,Approved
"Very nice and sleek look, controls are very intuitive and the slider for power level works great. Connected to a single phase but power management works really well. So far very pleased with the purchase",Approved
"Really impressed with the Machine, easy to connect and get going, so quiet in comparison to our Bosch, quick wash and steam feature are brilliant.",Approved
The integrated microwave is easy to use after you have got used to the settings.,Approved
"Lots of different programs and cool design.
Totally recommend it.",Approved
This unit did not work and was out of use for 10 days until repaired. Dan transit,Approved
Had new in a recent house purchase and noticed soon after moving in small rust flecks in the grain of the stainless steel. Have yet to resolve with either the builder or AEG.,Approved
Hard to clean not worth price I paid not good for large pots /pans frame on top not suitable for large items will not buy aeg again,Approved
"Smart looking appliance. No little buttons to clog up, easy to use touch sensitive display panel. A powerful extractor. So far, I have only used 1st & 2nd setting. The lights are brilliant when cooking and give that extra ambience to the room.",Approved
Love the 5th ring as we do a lot of stir fries and the wok sits safely on the ring. Easy to clean and looks good.,Approved
"Very disappointed with this dishwasher, takes to long ,doesn't take as many dishes as it should , glasses nightmare to fit in , and door top soaking after each wash .",Approved
This is my second Aeg steam generator. Very happy with my first but our very hard water wears my irons out quickly. I'll be more vigilant with this one!,Approved
"Good quality look to the hob and lots of space for pans and hot plates to be stood. Controls seem good quality as do the pan supports. If there was one niggle, hence the slightly lower score than I would normally provide for AEG products it is that smaller pans aren’t secure and easily wobble / spill",Approved
"Works really well BUT surface scratches very, very easily",Approved
We purchased this cooker 5 years ago and were delighted with it...after accidently breaking the hob it was replaced by our insurance and we are now even more delighted...the advances over the last 5 years have made this an even more desirable essential in our lives...superb!,Approved
"Was a little bit worried by reading some of the previous reviews about the steam venting out of the top but isn’t an issue for me. Might be different if you don’t have a tiled/splash back above the cooker. 
Cooker looks great and sleek. Love how big both ovens are. Took a little getting uses to but that’s the same with anything new. Been using cooker for a few months now and truly impressed by it. Definitely recommend!",Approved
"Have been using my new 5 ring gas hob now for almost month. It is a real upgrade on what we were using before. Installs into the gap a 4 burner came out of as well! Build quality and component quality seems really high with excellent controllability for the intensity of the flame and the cast iron grate on top is nice and heavy. Flame is focussed on the bottom of the pan and seems strong and the safety cut out is very reassuring. VERY pleased with my purchase. Cheers, AEG! :)",Approved
"Only down side is my failure to read the instructions closely. Had failed to read the part that suggests 
heating the oven on a high temperature for 10 minutes to clear fat build up! I clean my oven frequently, was amazed at the fat that had accumulated!! Do read this part of the booklet!",Approved
"Love this dishwasher never had one before and so glad we chose this AEG one. So easy to use 3 programs so not to confuse. Easy to clean and add salt , rinsed etc. Would definitely recommend this to anyone.",Approved
My first electric oven after more than 40 years of cooking on gas. After initial concerns found how easy to use.,Approved
I am really pleased with this product. The design & features are very good.,Approved
"Packed up after 15 days after installation (owned for 50 days) - Power control failure, AEG refused to replace as I'd owned it past the 30 days, but they then forgot to order the replacement part, AEG still insisted on a repair first. Thankfully the company i have bought it fromhave seen sense and offered me a replacement. Will never buy AEG again.",Rejected
This product is very easy to use for both stairs and cleaning the car.,Approved
Design could be improved. Doors catch slightly on closing making it feel clunky. Side rails do not come out / impossible to remove. The racks are slightly cupped making removal of trays difficult. Functionality is excellent and oven looks great. Very quiet when in use and cooks evenly.,Approved
Fabulous even cooking. Very fast to reach temperature. Looks great. Huge second oven.,Approved
"For an expensive cooker, there are some strange features: unlike our old cooker, the grill only has one setting meaning that you have to move the pan up and down although there are limited places to actually do that. Also, the shelves don’t fit directly above one another due to the guards on the back of them so you can’t actually use two consecutive shelf rails meaning that the large size oven is relevant. It also takes a extremely long time for the oven to heat up fully.",Approved
"Mum is really pleased with this cooker. We have had the cooker for a short time and Mum has taken to it,baking an apple pie over the weekend.",Approved
I love this oven. It looks great and is fun to use. There are many different settings which can be confusing and I have only used one so far but now I have got the hang of how to set it up I can try the others.,Approved
"The HK624010FB AEG ceramic electric hob we bought makes an annoying beeb sound each time you click or touch a control. This is too often when changing the temperature up and down.

Why can't we try hobs before we buy them? we just cannot. I did not get told this was a feature before i bought it. I hope this can inform others who might buy it.",Approved
"Pro's
Great looking four ring hob.
Very quick to boil pan full of water.
Absolutely brilliant slider controls. One control for each of the rings that respond to the touch very well.
Minute minder/count down timer is very useful and easy to use.
Cons
English translation of the manual is not easy to understand. No wiring instructions in the manual.
No wiring link for UK installation is supplied.
Bevelled edge looks great but could be vulnerable to damage.
The fitted rubber seal leaves a gap between the hob and the worktop.",Approved
"Having good results with baking so far and cooking. Enjoying being able to see and reach items easily, only criticism is dials not easy to read and have to keep checking instruction book to use the right settings and check the temperature correct.",Approved
Good looking contemporary gas hob top. Nice clean looking lines with more than enough space for all your pots and pans.,Approved
I am really impressed with the look of this appliance and its features especially the child lock and the controllability.,Approved
"This hob turns itself of while you are cooking and you can't turn that zone on again until it had cooled, so you have to swap to another zone..",Approved
"As an upgrade for an old (15 year+) solid plate hob, this is light years ahead in how quickly it heats things up. It is very easy to clean too. I installed this myself, wiring it to a 32amp connector box. If you don't know what you are doing then an electrician or professional installer is recommended.",Approved
Impressed how easy to use the new equipment. Good to have new modern eqipment that fits so well into kitchen,Approved
Researched buying a double oven This AEG model looked like the right choice. Looks good but oven display so feint cannot be read. Not all functions work in both ovens at same time. AEG advertising of product is misleading as it does not do what it features . AEG used to be a top brand - what has happened? Still waiting for resolution after nearly two months. Wish we had chosen another brand with proper customer service,Approved
Before we moved from a conventional gas cooker I was concerned about the level of fine control that might be achieved with an induction hob. My fears however have been unfounded and this induction hob with its touch sensitive slider controls works extremely well over the whole range of heating levels.,Approved
"A great addition to the kitchen streamline appearance with the 
use of energy saving hob and perfect oven size. Great",Approved

Excellent freezer. Looks good very quiet and does a superb job of freezing home made dishes. Love the accelerated freezing mode. Drawers are spacious and very easy to just either pull out as a drawer or pull out completely. Very satisfied with this product - I bought 2 and would highly recommend. A massive improvement on my last freezer.,Approved
"A brilliant peice of modern technology which has brought our kitchen bang up to date.
Not only is this an elegant looking hob, it oozes technology.
Its very simple to operate with a very useful users manual. There's even a provided time and heat setting chart which gives excellent cooking results on par to a cookbook.
In the short time we have had the hob installed, it has been put thru its paces.
All the features work and all are all very useful.
Not a hob full of gimmicks, but full of clever technology.
My husband enjoys using the touch control sliders and the extra power feature. No more trying to keep the old styled knobs clean.
While I find the one press hold function so clever and useful.
I had read induction was good, but this hob by AEG really has made cooking in our kitchen alot more pleasant.
It makes judgement, control of when something should be ready, STRESS FREE.
Well done AEG.",Approved
"Great product, lovely design - so easy to clean. Easy controls that were even better than than the earlier model we had......UNFORTUNATELY, the product is not very tough and after only 1 week it has had a cup dropped on it causing the hob to crack / split from the edge, right across the hob. Really disappointing!",Approved
"I was delighted to review the AEG induction hob. I chose to review the smaller induction hob because I had a limited amount of space in my kitchen to add this as a feature. It first of all looks great! and I love the fact that it is so easy to clean. When, 5 years ago I converted to an aga, the ability to cook food with precision on a hob was the thing I have missed most of all. It was delightful to be able to cook with the exact heat level that I wanted. But more than that the aeg product really allows you to do this incredibly rapidly and without having to remove saucepans from heat whilst you wait for things to stop bubbling or cool down.
I particularly like the ability to boost the heat and with young, hungry children this was a fantastic feature for having to make food quickly with the chaos of busy lives!
Finally, I was very reassured by the safety of the immediacy of coolng that happens with this hob and this was important to me due to the open plan nature of my kitchen. Oh! And one more thing...the kids found it so easy to use that they are cooking more now !",Approved
"It only lasted a few months beyond the warranty before needing a very expensive repair, and I did not get any related customer service support other than a response that amounted to tough luck you are out of warranty.",Approved
"Easy to use, good variety of cycles, very quiet, slighty narrower depth meant it fitted really well under the worktop. Time setting for drying is useful for smaller loads! All in all an excellent buy!",Approved
"I like the quality of this dishwasher but would prefer more height on top drawer also the white seals were hard to fit even for an experienced fitter. On the whole it is working satisfactory and I am pleased with it, also I am very pleased with the way the AEG Ireland supplier handled my problem
with previous machine.",Rejected
This double oven offers power/performance for even large dishes. However the lack of temperature settings for the grill does do the overall product a bit of a disservice.,Approved
"After changing the kitchen we chose to have an induction hob... I used to have gas, but occasionally left it on low without realising. The indiction hob seemed a safer option. It cuts off when there is no pan on it. It heats water vety quickly and i like how i can control it.
I chose this model as it senses the size of the pan being used, the others i looked at didnt do this. I like the versatility. And it cleans easliy too..",Approved
"Works well but it is difficult to see what setting and or temperature the controls are on as they are at the side of a push in knob!

Even worse if you are not tall enough to see the top of these knobs and I would expect then to wear away with use!

There is no Grill Pan handle for putting in in or removing it as it does get hot!",Approved
"Loving my new oven, very stylish with some great features.",Approved
Efficient cooker. Good convector. Still haven't received cash back yet? or free product !,Approved
"This cooker was installed in our new home, not necessarily what I would have chosen, but its a really good cooker. Easy to use, very pleased with it.",Approved
"The washing machine has many features,including time saving, anti wrinkle, and a choice of temperatures and spin speeds. I find it very versatile.",Approved
"Excellent extraction, easy to install and very easy to use.
3 speeds to help move cooking fumes from the kitchen it looks good for an extractor. I would recommend this product, but I would say I think it should come with LED lights instead of the tungsten ones, to save on some energy.",Approved
"A good product that does what it says on the box, a three speed fan and twin lamps.
Would recommend this product.",Approved
Really good product would highly recommend. No problems with it what so ever,Approved
"I was selected by AEG to receive the product free of charge in return for my honest review.

I have to admit that at first I wasn’t sure on the sliding touch controls, I thought they would be non-responsive once dirty and I would constantly be pressing my finger to make it work. It took a little getting used to after using a standard gas hob for so long, however I quickly got used to it and it is so easy to use – very responsive. I did find that the controls did not work as smoothly with wet or cold hands. As the hob is glass, I initially thought it was going to be difficult to keep clean as quite often glass can look smeary. I found that wiping the hob down with a warm damp cloth and drying it with a dry cloth ensured there were no smears, and it really is very shiny! It looks sleek, modern and has some great features.

Unlike a traditional gas hob it is so much easier to clean with no parts to take off or wipe around which is a massive hidden benefit.

One of my favourite features is that the hob turns itself off if it is left untouched for a while which really does give me piece of mind. Also I love the fact you can keep food warm on the Stop & Go function, it allows you to leave the food for a few minutes knowing it will not get cold or overcooked. Overall, a great product!",Approved
"On fitting only one speed of the three was working. Very good at rectifying the problem but very little difference in the three speeds. The most ineffective extractor hood we have ever had,",Approved
First device had to be returned due to main engine failure.,Approved
"This cooker has taken a bit of getting used to as it has a lot more features than the old one it replaced.
The quality is very good- the main reason we bought it.
Only issues- 
Instructions needed regularly in the first few days! 
No handle on the grill! Though this seems consistent with other modern cookers.",Approved
"Great reliable product however on occasion takes a bit to turn on, not sure if this is down to body warmth. Great ability to turn on and off each ring at seperate times to auto start/stop",Approved
Very good performance. My only gripe with the hob is that it scratches very easily. Its only been 15 days and its badly scratched. My previous gas hob did not have this issue. I do not know if this is only specific to my unit.,Approved
"This hob is really attractive set in my granite worktops. I decided to change from using gas, as I thought it would be cleaner and quicker. It is all of that, and much more. So much more controllable and precise. I would never go back to gas.",Approved
"Fast, responsive and adaptable. 
We had tried induction cooking on a single hob for a couple of years since our (much loved) Aga would not give out enough heat to fire up the wok to the searing temperature that we like to stir fry. 
This hob does it all and the temperature is instantly controllable. 
We adore it and the build quality is excellent as you would expect from this well-established firm",Approved
"This cooker is great. It offers instant heat, cooking food quickly and thoroughly in record time in the oven, grill and on the hob.
Its self-cleaning, and is still spotless, (we've had it for over 3 weeks now) The oven space is vast, so we can cook a huge family meal all at the same time! It isn't an ostentatious cooker, by which I mean it has all the necessary functions but doesn't look extremely flash ...no bright shiny dials....flashing lights...or 'look at me' design. But the interior oven light is perfect for watching those cakes rise, the clock / timer is supremely functional ......Even my husband loves this cooker!",Approved
"Substandard product with uneven pan supports
Pans rock  AEG refuse to recognise they have quality issues do not purchase this model",Approved
After four days of use this dishwasher is impossible to live with.  The bottom basket tips up and to one side if you load it from the back.  The bottom basket will not stay out of the machine when loading.  When lots of plates in the bottom it keeps jamming on the lower rotating arm when trying to put it back in  There in literally no where to load mugs or glasses.  Appalling design AEG,Rejected
"After extensive research I plunged for cooking by induction f9r the 1st time. One of the selling features was spills not burning onto the surface of the hob. Well that doesn't work as the condensation from steaming certainly baked itself on. Another advertised feature of induction cooking was the £10 under the pan test which according to adverts will not burn that failed too. Another failure was only the immediate pan area will get hot where the magnetic elements meet each other, not so. 3 to 4 inches outside of the pan area maybe me jump for the cold water tap. So everything I had seen was either b.......t or complete nonsense. I am no better off on terms od safety n control now than I was with my old Halogen.",Rejected
"My first experience with an induction hob. Very easy to use although I have not got round to using all the different features. I am very satisfied with the product. The cleaning of the hob is a pleasure, so quick and easy. I just love it.",Approved
"We went for this model attractetd by the size, no knobs, seperate controls for each ""ring"" and overall quality. We didnt like the idea of going to induction (the cost of replacing pans would have been horrendous) so stuck with ceramic. This is a great hob, easy to use, with clever technology eg seperate timer control over each ring. The slider and touch controls work faultlessly

One issue I should pint out is when wiring it in you do need to use a brass jumper thats included in the applincae. It isnt totally clear on the wiring diagram (and not in text at all). If you dont use it, the controls do nothing so the hob looks dead.",Approved
"Yes, it's a kettle. How can one get excited by a kettle?! Well, when you drink cup after cup of perfectly brewed coffees and teas, you really begin to appreciate what a critical role the correct temperature has in extracting the most flavour, without burning and ruining the ground coffee or tea leaves. The variable temperature settings are extremely useful and have revolutionised the quality of the beverages I make at home. 
The design is superb, featureset brilliant and it's fast. Yup, this kettle excites and I can't recommend it highly enough!",Approved
"Brilliant machine. Looks good, quiet and cleans lovely. Love the cutlery drawer, didn't think I would but it's great. Would buy again for sure.",Approved
I had this oven fitted in June 2017 and I am very pleased with it. It cooks a little quicker than my old oven but that was 10+ years old! I would highly recommend this oven.,Approved
Very quiet fridge with plenty of space for a large family. The pull out drawers makes finding products very easy. Easy to clean and maintain with an easy install.,Approved
"I particularly like the induction hob, it is so fast to heat things up but also so controllable and as it doesn't get hot and burn spills it is easy to keep clean.

I haven't used all the oven features yet, but the ones I have used work well and the top oven really is an effective oven, unlike on my old cooker.",Approved
This seems to be a reliable product with good functions but wish it had a keep food warm function,Approved
"When I purchased the washing machine I didn't realise it had as many features as it has got, it is so quiet as well, and makes easy work of the washing with the large drum size.

I would highly recommend the machine to anyone as its so easy to use",Approved
"I have to point out to you, that I was selected to be given these products by AEG in return for writing a frank & honest review of the products.
I have always been one of those people who loved a Gas hob as it heated up quickly....when I recently moved to where I live now, it had a ceramic hob, which drove me crazy! Took ages to heat up, it took ages to then cool back down, couldn't fit large pans on it properly etc etc.....I hated it with a passion!!!
Oh my!!! I love the induction hob! I had a slight crisis the first day it was fitted when my daughter decided to try it out my poaching herself some eggs for brunch, and we realised that none of our pots & Pans were suitable for induction! (Lol, she then decided on scrambled!) After a quick dash to Asda, where we bought a saucepan set & a large frying pan (reasonable prices too, not ridiculously expensive, which is what I thought they would be!)
We arrived back home, & it wasn't until later when I was cooking a seafood linguine, that I realized how amazing it was! Whilst boiling the pan of water for the Linguine, it boiled amazingly quickly! Far quicker than boiling an electric kettle, which is what I would usually do! Its absolutely brilliant, takes a little while to get used to what settings u need to put things on, but thats the same with everything you use for the first few times! In fact, I was so impressed at its length of time to boil water, I immediately invested in an induction kettle, as the amount of tea we drink in this house, I reckon I must have cut down my electricity bill by masses!!! Another good feature as I have the 80cm induction hob, is that you arent held back by the size of what pans you can use, as the way they are spaced out is so that its easy to fit large pans on the hob! The other great benefit is that its so easy to keep clean! I'll never go back to using a gas hob again, thats for sure!!!!! I'd definitely recommend this product, in fact, I already have to two of my friends!",Rejected

"It's difficult to give a fair review of this dish washer as we've hardly used it, our machine failed within 2 days of operation. Due to our commitments we are only able to have the repair engineer attending tomorrow. I'm hoping that this fault is due to finger trouble and not equipment failure.
Our AEG oven is 15 years old and still works and looks like new.",Approved

"Not only does this AEG HK884400XG induction hob look high end but it also has the features to back up the aesthetically pleasing looks. Along with the great safety features the hob also has user friendly controls, which once mastered are a joy to use. The energy saving ""OKO timer"" is a superb idea and one that I use daily! To sum up, after years of using many other brands I would not hesitate to recommend AEG to anyone and everyone.",Approved
"This product failed within a week of installation. It has had every electronic circuit board replaced one at a time. The hob then worked very well until it totally failed again this week. It was taken away for repair and has been returned it is now back to square one as it was when it first failed (working but not functioning correctly).. When the original faults occurred I asked AEG customer service to replace the hob as it was brand new, they flatly refused. This is because I purchased the hob prior to completion of my kitchen and it was not installed immediately. I have had many AEG products in the past and I have been very impressed with their quality, longevity and customer service but alas I think this is a thing of the past.",Rejected
"Previous cooker was an AEG with a ceramic hob. Concerning the oven the new model is almost identical but a bit more roomy, however, the induction hob is a great improvement. Wish we had tried this before - truly excellent.",Approved
"We replaced existing built in hob and oven to get a bigger oven for cooking our Christmas dinner. 
Induction hob as good as cooking on gas.",Approved
"This is the second one of these hobs purchased ~ The first one was in our last house was absolutely superb!
It therefore stood to reason that in our new house and having the kitchen ripped out that we would once again go for AEG and of course this hob features in the new kitchen. It is BIG but the features are great, and it is very easy to clean. Touch controls are great and the rings heat up immediately. Everybody who sees this hob goes ""WOW"" and yes we agree it is stunning simplicity!! It is not an induction hob, so you are not restricted to the types of pans to be used. If you are looking for a great looking hob which works well and looks great then give serious consideration to this one you will not be disappointed. Highly recommended!!",Approved
"There are two features that are bad / poor. Like most older people the higher frequency end of hearing is reduced, the alarm / notification buzzer is of the low volume higher frequency type which myself wife and others cannot here unless standing at cooker. The other minor aspect is the clock timer being ontop of the cooker can only be view again if standing over cooker. Everything else about cooker seems very good.",Approved
"Initially our kitchen extractor fan died and we replaced with an AEG DBB5660HM Chimney Cooker Hood and bery happy with the fan. So much I decided to replace the old gas hob with the AEG HKB75NB540 Gas Hob also. Both work in unison as the controller from the gas hob can communicate with the extractor fan. The inbuilt timer is also brilliant for countdown on cooking. Tough glass on top is easy to clean and doesn't scratch like the old stainless steel hob. I also like the idea of indicators when hob is on and telling when ok to touch again.

Great two products and the Asian family also pleased.",Approved
"It has taken some time to get used to the speed and efficiency of this Hob. Initially lots of pots boiling over simply because we were used to leaving them for so much longer before they reached cooking temperature. All thing being relative it feels almost instant. The controls are easy to use and again took some getting use to as they are very responsive, lots of good features, so the power of automatically if you lift a pot. Simple, economical, attractive and very functional, couldnt recommend it enough.",Approved
"We purchased this product to replace an ageing conventional halogen hob, and we were concerned over so many things that we should not have been; the unit is pure simplicity to operate and does have some very special features if you have an AEG extractor fan, this can be linked automatically to the unit also, it can handle long dishes as well as conventional round pans and the ""P"" setting brings pans to the boil in an instant, you can then just turn the heat down to simmer or even lower.
Safety was paramount when we decided to purchase, so as well as having a child lock on the hob, the unit will automatically shut down everything if it senses that no pans are in place, we did have to replace two of our saucepans as these were not compatible also our steamer which was glass however; the cooking speed, and control has more than made up for this additional cost.",Approved
The fast heat up boils water in a minute and so easy to clean,Approved
"Great product, pairs with extractor fan. Easy to use, very responsive and very well built",Approved
Game changer in the kitchen. A breeze to adapt to and use.,Approved
"Really easy to use, very responsive controls, and compared to our previous gas hob an absolute delight to clean! Only been using it for two weeks now, so early days, but all good so far.",Approved
"All round bevels enhance this hob's good looks and the location and feel of the touch controls make it a joy to use. A feature that I have found particularly useful is the automatic heat up. This is brilliant! When needing to boil water to cook pasta or potatoes I just set this automatic control, the water comes to the boil faster and more efficiently than my kettle and then just settles itself back to a healthy simmer. This is the best induction hob I have ever used, easy to control and fast to respond. Just wonderful! So glad I chose AEG.",Approved
A great hob. Justas controllable as our old gas hob but stays clean and cool. One downside the instructions say that it comes with a scraper cleaner - but was not in the box!,Approved
"A few things are wrong with this product, that when added together make it overall average at best. Firstly, the touchpad buttons are painful, you have to press and press and press before it works. Also, there are no heating presets which would be very useful. 
The extractor has a knob in the middle which is dull and looks like it is has had the shiny layer scratched. 
The fan is incredibly noisy - do not get the recirculating version. 
Going back to my original point on the touch recognition (this is my biggest annoyance and I often find myself shouting at the hob) to turn one heating zone off you have to select it and then press minus until it goes to zero why can’t it just be turned off with the press of a button? AEG need to work out how to make the cooking process easier with less clicks required.
Overall it looks good and a bit different but there are too many little problems. I wish I hadn’t bought this, my last induction hob was brilliant. As soon as you put your finger on the buttons it came to life. This just isn’t the same sorry.",Approved
"Love all the features on this product. Looks good and great quality. Very quick response to change in heat,and also very easy to keep clean",Approved

Easy to use and to clean. Great features. Recommended.,Approved
I have got used to it now and very happy with it. It matches our AEG oven,Approved
Having never had a dishwasher I am quite pleased with this but am a little disappointed with the drying.As there are only two people in our household I would have liked a programme that did a half load. I do not think that the manual is particularly good.Very confused about when you use the all in one tablets whether you use a rinse aid and how much do you use.However I am very pleased with the washing result as my crockery is sparkling and wish I hadn't waited so long to have one.,Approved
"I previously owned a ceramic hob but we have now upgraded an AEG Induction hob and I wish I had done it much sooner.
A really important feature for me with my new hob is that when cooking, the area around the pan stays cool. This has enabled me to clean up any overspills quicker and easier without the fear of getting burnt or having to wait until the area is cool enough to clean, by which time, the overspill has ‘cemented’ itself on with a risk to marking the surface. A real labour saving feature.
The controls are so easy to understand and the response to the highering or lowering of the temperature changes is instant. 
Another thing that struck me, apart from the ease of the controls, was the rapid speed in which you could boil water when using the PowerBoost function. Gone are the days of having to wait up to 10 minutes for a pot of cold water to reach boiling point when preparing to cook large quantities of pasta or potatoes. 
As an added bonus, the timer is also very welcome. He’s no Masterchef but My husband can now consistently make the perfect ‘soft’ boiled eggs.
Overall, we are now getting great cooking results in less time and it goes without saying that this is another great quality product from AEG that it not only looks good but also more than justifies us having to buy a shiny new set of induction friendly pans.",Approved
Heats up quickly. The large double option is great too.,Approved
"This hob replaced my older AEG hob (which was great) and I have been using this one for the past two weeks now. I cook a lot and use various cooking methods. So far I have tried this hob with slow cooked stews, risottos, choux pastry, stir fries, rice pudding and steaks  - most of these dishes require temperature precision and power and I had perfect results every single time. 

First of all, I can control the temperature within very narrow ranges and ensure my food is cooked at the perfect temperature. Temperature changes are instant when I change the temperature. It definitely feels like using a gas hob but only more powerful. I can cook a rice pudding at low heat without having to stir it and it cooks to perfection. When I need to boil water fast, I can use the power function to boil it faster than my kettle could. 

The hob is very powerful too. When I need very high temperatures to sear a steak or cook a stir-fry, I have the high temperatures I need. I have used gas hobs for years and I seriously cannot remember it being as powerful as this. I haven't done a scientific comparison of two using thermometers but it definitely feels like my induction hob heats up more and faster.

Induction hobs can produce buzzing and humming sounds at high temperatures and this hob is no exception. This is generally caused by the cooking utensils themselves. However, although I haven't changed any of my pots or pans, this hob is making considerably less humming and buzzing sounds compared to my previous one. It is actually quieter than my fan assisted oven which was certainly not the case with my previous induction hob so I am very happy with it.

If I there's only one criticism I can make, it is the controls. My previous hob had a sliding scale type temperature control for each ring. I could instantly set a temperature just by touching on the corresponding temperature on the slider scale. With this hob, one have to cycle through different temperatures to reach the desired temperature. Not a biggie and I am already getting used to these controls.

Overall, this is a great piece of kit and I can suggest it to anyone without hesitation.",Approved
"AEG IKB64301FB INDUCTION HOB. I previously owned a gas hob and I never thought that i would ever go electric and now I'm kicking myself wishing I'd done it sooner. Not only does it look amazing in my kitchen the display is easy to use and you have so much control over the temperature. I could not believe how quickly it would boil water, I can boil a pot of water in less than 60 Seconds, its simply amazing. Furthermore, the product is very easy to clean which helps save a lot of time in the kitchen and helps keep my kitchen appear spotless. In addition, this model also makes cooking a lot more safer and easier, the pot handles and lid remain at warm temperatures so you do not need to worry about getting burnt, also the actual heating pods do not get very hot due to it being induction so you don't have to worry when cleaning or accidentally burning yourself, which is efficient when you have children or teens around, as they are much safer and they can also get more involved in the kitchen which is good for themselves when learning how to cook. Lastly, the hob also has a feature where you can adjust the extractor fan from the hob, but unfortunately I do not have an AEG extractor so i can not test out this feature, but it will be next item of purchase so i can test all the functions available on the Hob and write a full review. Overall, all I can say is that I highly recommend you purchase one of these induction hobs, its fast,safe and easy to use and look truly amazing and really is worth the money and will significantly improve your kitchen experience.
Strongly Recommended!",Approved
"I don't know how i have missed out on induction hobs before. This has been a revelation. I had been put off buying one by people saying I would need to replace all my pans. After 30years owning them, this was a good excuse to buy new anyway. The first time I used the hob for rice using cold water, I was amazed at the speed of the boil point in the pan. It seems strange not seeing the ring turn red, and to feel the heat, you just see the bubbles of boiling water. The instant speedy reaction of the controls from high boosted heat, straight to immediate simmering, was also pleasing. As was the timer on the ring which was so easy to use. The rings are different sizes to accommodate different pan sizes which give better cooking results. The hob is really easy to keep clean, I use a microfiber cloth which clears any spills. It looks good in my kitchen against black granite too. Due to the speed of the heat directly into the pan, rather than waiting for the pan to heat, then waiting for the pan to heat the food, I have spent less time at the hob which ultimately must save my electricity bills too. Which is a bonus. Highly recommended.",Approved
"Switching from a gas hob to an induction was great, cheaper to run, more controllable and even cooking heat.  This hob looks great with its sleek minimal design and easy to care for finish, wipe clean.  It has 4 hobs and three sizes, although I sometimes wish it has two smaller hobs than two medium.  The controls are easy to use and sensitive to touch but won't go crazy if you spill something on them.  It has plenty of power to heat when used with good quality cookware.  The timer is great to switch off hobs when they are done, and the hood2hob feature sounds good but a little gimmicky as you need a comparable good to test, which I don't have so I can't comment on it.  The internals are quiet on operation, my previous induction hob made quite loud wurring and clicking noises, this one does not.
Overall a very nice hob.",Approved
"After cooking on 2 portable induction hobs for 4 Year’s it has took me several months to find an induction hob that would simmer, surprisingly not all have that function, I went to John Lewis and they rang AEG for me to find out if this model would simmer and was told yes so I bought it.
I’m finding it good to cook on though I do have to have the settings higher than I’m used to but that’s not a problem I just have to get used to it.
I find the layout of the rings not what I would like,there is a large at front left and two medium at the back and a small to front right, I think the small front right should be at the back and the medium at the front.
That said I am pleased with the hob and it looks good.
Also got it at a good price £279.",Approved
The timer feature for each hob is really useful and nice to have. Also found the 'power' function speeds things up. Settings returning to previously set temperature after removing pan for short period is great. Stop / go useful for answering phone or door bell without spoiling food. Don't use the child lock but would if there were young ones in the kitchen. Hob looks great and so easy to clean. We love it.,Approved
"Great oven, very easy to use. Steam bake makes cake making almost infallible! Family love the grill plus feature, for speedy grilling and grill is large enough to get enough bacon on for all the family in one go! Highly recommended. Icing on the cake is the self clean feature, no more chemicals, soaking and scrubbing.",Approved
"We have had this AEG IKB64401FB induction hob for a few weeks now and are delighted with it. It has 4 rings (2 medium, 1 small and 1 extra-large), each of which can be fully controlled independently of one another. I know this sounds like a strange comment but our previous hob used the same power adjustment for all four rings and involved multiple presses in order to make adjustments. This hob is so much better as a result and the fact that you can use the slider bar to adjust the power or simply press along the power line is a dream. Each ring has its own timer function too, neat. For safety and reassurance there are a host of auto switch off features and a handy lock feature too. Something that was a real surprise was the pause feature, this basically puts all active rings in low power mode until you are ready to resume, handy if the doorbell rings. The hob also features something called Hob2Hood, that can magically control your compatible AEG hood for you, doing things like turning the light on and setting the fan speed for you, we don't have an AEG hood to comment first hand though, but certainly sounds like useful use of technology. Nice and easy to keep clean and looks really smart. You can buy this hob with confidence it is certainly a premium piece of kitchen hardware.",Approved

"Good size, lots of functionality and easy to use. gets up to temperature quickly and lets you know if still heating up or cooling down. Great options on cooking, top, bottom, grill, humidity and self cleaning too! Would be nice if it could tell you the current temperature, but you can tell in other ways.",Approved
I am very pleased with this electric ceramic hob. A good size and plenty of room for many sizes of pans to cook at the same time. I especially like a heat control and slide control for each element. It also has a built in minute timer you can use independently for each element. Overall an excellent hob easy and logical operation with well thought out design and ergonomics for a busy kitchen. Very pleased with my purchase.,Approved
"I totally agree with Elsa55’s review below.  We just got a beautiful new kitchen and this was part of the package.  I have never used an AEG product before and won’t ever again.  It takes far too long, is noisy and does not clean very well.  I regularly have to rewash dishes after a cycle.  Both shelves are very badly designed.  It says in the manual that it can accommodate 13 place settings which is rubbish.  I continually have to repack it to get even a fraction of these dishes in.  I have tried numerous combinations of glasses and mugs in the upper shelf and they continually fall over so you can really only have one row of glasses or mugs on each side which makes it so inefficient.",Approved
"Good evan heating. Really good that the power function is on all rings, can heat up very quick with any ring.
I use the timer function alot and I am able to time each ring separately.
I like that each ring has a circle so its makes it easy to make sure pans are in the right place. 
The smallest ring is at the front which is ideal as some others have it at the back but I wouldn't be able to do sauces etc if its at the back as they need constant stirring, as its at the front I can stir and see it as needed.
I haven't come across any faults so far, easy and simple to use!",Approved

"Delighted with my new freezer, and pleased it will survive ambient temperatures well below freezing sometimes, as it has to be housed in the stand-alone garage - in Scotland. I would have liked more baskets/trays, the two supplied are not very sturdy......but overall it is functioning well and I feel it was an excellent buy for the price I paid for it.",Approved
"Very happy with this product, it has about a dozen settings, its very quiet when in operation, it has a quick wash, when we first used it we thought it was faulty, as when the wash has finished the door pops open a couple of inches so that the plates etc air dry, what a great idea... it's a lot better than our old dishwasher.",Approved
The wash cycle is good and things come out clean. The only draw back is the top and bottom 'shelves' and wobbly and not sturdy.,Approved
"This cooker stood out when we were looking on line and in stores. The AEG has a very stylish appearance with an attractive bow front and stainless features and the absence of control knobs gives the cooker a clean shape. We are delighted with the function of the induction hob , easy to keep clean and brilliant control of heating. Better than any cooker we have had before.The ovens are easy to use and control and we are amazed at the the large size. The easy clean interior is most welcome. We looked at less expensive products but we are pleased we chose this one.",Approved
"Excellent quality dishwasher at a great price. Economic to run, love the way the door opens itself when the program has finished running to aid drying. Highly recommend.",Approved
"Stacking this dishwasher is easy and has plenty of room for plates, pots and cups - enough to keep a family of five in clean dishes everyday. It's really important to our family that a dishwasher can achieve a thorough wash within 30 mins as there is a constant demand.",Approved
"After having an induction hob in my previous kitchen I found switching to a gas hob in my new home not as much pleasure to use. The main reasons I regretted the change were the cleaning after use and pan handles getting hot when cooking. Also I think it will prove to be cheaper to use because all of the heat appears goes into pan, on the gas hob there appeared to be a lot of heat wasted.",Approved
I love this. It heats so quick and consistently so I can understand why it got its rating.....its simply does the job very well,Approved
Good design and quiet but...only really washes properly on full power. Takes 2 hours+ to wash. Always defaults to eco setting on startup...v annoying. Upper tray only really designed for plates. Had an 8 yr old AEG dishwasher. Wish id had it repaired now instead of trading it in.,Approved
"I have had this dishwasher for several weeks now. It takes a full load with ease. Love the cutlery tray, so much easier than a basket. Dishes, glasses and cutlery have come out sparkling and clean, even with porridge and eggs stuck on.",Approved
"Moved to a new house which had a ceramic job. Found it very uncontrollable, especially after coming from gas. Always wanted to try induction, but thought too expensive. When I saw the recent AEG promotion, I decided to go ahead. What a revelation is all I can say. Fast, controllable and easy to clean. Luckily I already had suitable saucepans, so no extra expense there. I would thoroughly recommend. I installed myself, which was easy, except the new hob was slightly deeper, so had to do a little woodwork on the carcass. Really enjoying cooking with this job.",Approved
"My husband convinced me to purchase this induction hob for our new kitchen. I was very dubious as I have only ever used gas hobs and was concerned that the induction hob would not be as responsive. How wrong was I. It's absolutely brilliant. It boils a pan of water super quick and for food that needs to simmer gently, again it's brilliant. It's much easier to clean than a gas hob so another advantage. Overall I am very happy with this item and would recommend anyone to buy this hob.",Approved
"I have had this hob installed for a few weeks now and am suitably impressed. It was easy to install providing you have a suitably rated circuit. The operation of each of the zones is easy to use and the speed of operation is very similar to another leading brand that this hob has replaced at a considerably lower price.  The operation of the controls has taken some time to get used to especially with 14 levels which I personally is too much control for an average domestic kitchen and you really have to experiment to get the correct level for the produce you are heating or simmering.  One annoying element is the constant beep when an article is placed on the hob when it is switched off.  One of the benefits of a ceramic flush hob is its ability to provide additional work space, this feature should only be active when the hob is switched on.
Like other reviewers have been unable to test the Hob2Hood function as I do not have a compatible hood but the concept is a good idea.",Approved
Contacted customer services for a faulty filter part and advised that it wasnt covered by warranty and had to pay for a replacemnet.  Unit was purchased approx 5 months ago!,Rejected
"A fantastic cooker, great easy to use controls. Heats up very quickly and so easy to clean. Love this great new addition to our kitchen brilliantly engineered as you would expect from this manufacturer.",Approved
"The power boost heats a pan of water extremely fast and very easy to control. The timer is a useful addition. The controls are to one side leaving more space on the other for a larger pan which is also a more powerful cooking zone, giving even faster cooking.  The hob is very easy to operate. Im delighted with this hob and would recommend it to anyone wanting an excellent induction hob.",Approved
"After the efficient and quick install it was easy to use and super quick cook with. It sits neatly on the worktop and looks slick. The flexibility of having 5 cooking zones instead of the usual 4 is a good feature and gives added flexibility. The controls a really responsive and intuitive. There is a hob2hood feature which we couldn't try as we don't have a suitable hood, however the light does come on to show it is functioning when it should.",Approved

"We have just refurbished our Kitchen and whilst working with our builder and planning the kitchen he recommended we choose AEG or NEFF appliances as in his experience that provided a great balance of costs vs quality. The looked around and decided on AEG for both our Oven and Hob.
A kitchen design was very modern so decided we wanted a large surface area for cooking so included enough space for an 80CM Induction hob. The super glossy black Glass hob looks great set into the worktop. 
Once installed the first thing we decided to do was boil a small pan of water. We put the pan on the hob and put it on maximum, I was slightly concerned about using touch controls but needed have these ate sensitive to the touch and its nothing like touch panels from years ago where you were never sure you had activated it or not.
About 55 seconds later we had water bubbling in the pan which was amazing and much faster than our kettle.
We haven't done that much cooking yet but what we have done has been a pleasure. 1 thing I read is that Induction is more difficult to control the temp than gas, its not more difficult just different but you easily get used to it.
The other thing I read is that because of the magic of induction and the way it heats the food stuff doesn't get baked onto your pans so cleaning is easier. I can't be 100% sure and maybe its because we also bought new pans but they do seem to clean up easier. 
The only downsides dust shows up easily on gloss black so I found myself dusting it often.
Second and something that I hope will be a long term thing is will the glass mark or scratch overtime?
Overall im super happy with my AEG hob.",Approved
"This is so handy when you want a quick tidy and the suction is so good. 
Only criticism is no bump guard and the mechanism to fully empty the dust is a little flimsy so use it carefully",Approved

"So far have had it for two weeks and love it. Washes well,quiet, red light projecting on the floor is a bonus. Once finished the door opens automatically which I think is brilliant, the dishes and crockery come out dry and without water marks.",Approved
"Over the last few years I've had both gas and electric ceramic hobs but this is my first induction hob - and its brilliant. 
The heat is almost instantaneous and very controllable, not like a ceramic hob which continues to heat the pan for 5 minutes after you've turned it down! I love the Maxisense zones which automatically adjust their size according to the size of the saucepan placed on top - very clever.
I have a matching AEG cooker hood and it was recommended to get one slightly larger than hob, (something to do with induction not sending the steam staright up like a gas flame cooker) so for this 80cm hob I have a 100cm hood, works perfectly - alttough my extractor fan is not Hob2Hood enabled.
Highly recommended and I'm not going back to old fashioned gas or electric cermaic hobs now!",Approved
"This induction hob replaced a gas range cooker of 12 years. Before this I had used older electric hobs but had preferred the responsiveness of gas. A new modern kitchen prompted me to go for an induction hob, with the promise of gas-like instant heating control.  

I now love induction!  The heating power surpasses my old 'wok burner' and with the PowerBoost mode it will boil water faster than my electric kettle. The heat is very controllable too and I can change the heat setting instantly.  Cleaning is easy. Because the hob does not get very hot, spilt food does not burn in.  A simple wipe with a cloth is all that is needed. My new pans are also as-new with no discolouration caused by gas burners.

Aside from these basics, I also appreciate the smart features of this hob.  Whilst it can cope with any regular size pan using the MaxiSense feature, it can also group zones automatically to allow you to heat larger oven trays which is great for browning meat and heating oils for roast potatoes.  The hob will automatically shut down if there are no pans detected or I accidentally left it on for too long and the pause feature will lower the temperature whilst I am distracted by a doorbell or phone call. I have not tried the Hob2Hood feature which automatically controls the hob extractor and hoping AEG will release a cabinet built in model.

In summary, if your using a gas or electric hob currently, switch to induction, it has all the convenience with any of the hassle.  The AEG looks sleak and stylish and has lots of added functions.  Buy yourself a new pan set if needed and remember not to put heavy items in the cupboards above which could damage the hob if dropped.",Approved
"Just arrived today.  I had a Siemens dishwasher before and all the internal parts such as shelves, cutlery basket, cap for salt and rinse aid were robust.  The internal parts in this AEG one are very poor quality and the design of the top shelf is poor for tall glasses.  I’m not even sure what the purpose of the middle part is for. Quite dissapointed really as all our other AEG appliances Arrcreslly good hence why I bough this.",Rejected
It seems to be the modern way but programmes are very long. We expected a first class facility but the lack of drying is a problem. Also the machine is very light and moves at the slightest touch. We have made a mistake.,Approved

"I had my new hob installed about a month ago,  I had an AEG gas hob for 14 years before, and all my other appliances are also from AEG, and I was always happy with the quality of their products .

 I liked the responsiveness of the gas, so I was very pleased that my new hob turned out super responsive, too.  Plus the fact that it is really easy to clean made this hob an instant family favourite.  We stopped boiling the water for pasta in the kettle first in order to speed up boiling; with this hob we can boil water on the hob itself just as quickly.

The hob can also 'talk' to a compatible extractor fan, though I haven't been able to test this feature (yet?).   However the button for this feature looks like an internet connection sign and I tricked my children that the hob can be operated from their mobile phones which made them really interested to try to make it work.",Approved
"The IKE85431FB is an attractive looking hob with its gloss black top and bevelled edges. The hob is very easy to use so there’s no need to keep referring back to the owner’s hand book. The hob heats up quickly with its PowerBoost feature and cools down to hand touch moments later. The MaxiSense feature is ingenious where the heat is concentrated to the size of the pan hence no wasted heat. If you own a compatible AEG hood you may be able to take advantage of Hob2Hood feature too. The hob auto detects when a pan is placed on top so there’s no way of turning on the wrong hob. As the hob surface is knob free cleaning is a breeze, a job I hated with my old ceramic hob with the control knobs on top. Great product which I can highly recommend.",Approved
Easy to use and not too heavy. Picks up well but filter does need cleaning after each use. Does what I brought it for.,Approved
"The only reason I bought the drawer was to align with a compact appliance next to a full height appliance. The bottom of the drawer is over half a cm lower than the door of the main oven and an unsightly gap between the top of the warming drawer and the microwave compact oven that's sat on top of it.

Functionally, all 3 of my aeg ovens feature a keep warm function so renders this reasonably redundant - hence a very expensive way to get your ovens to not align!",Approved
"Description states evenly distributed heat. Mine is warm at the back and cold at the front. An engineer contacted AEG and was told, contrary to their description, that a 10 degree difference in temperature from back to front was acceptable. I have previously had a NEFF warming drawer which has an element in the base and works beautifully. This one is a very expensive waste of space.",Approved
"This is a great warming drawer, large capacity and functions very well. However my single complaint is that the indicator light is imperceptible in daylight and not much better in total darkness. It's therefore easy to forget to switch it off. This is compounded by it's almost silent operation (a good thing) which cannot be heard above even the lowest extractor fan setting. I wouldn't be without it but a simple design change would produce a five star product.",Approved
I bought it to vaccum the car ...it doe a great job. Its a bit heavy and the lead is long but that's good to get around the car.,Approved
It's just a warming draw. No great technological step forward but for all it's simplicity of purpose it has its failings. The 'on' light is not visible unless one is viewing it almost straight on; mine is well below eye-level. The heating is not uniform - it gets much hotter at the back of the draw than the front. The draw catch is not positive enough. The fan is quite noisy.,Approved

"This mixer is solidly engineered and works well, whether beating eggs, kneading dough or mixing a cake.

Having 2 bowls makes life much easier.

I don't like the fact that the whisk is not machine washable.

So, why the low rating?

I reported a fault on it about a month ago. I provided all the details that the online form asked for.
About a week later, I got a response, which included the details, asking me to repeat them.
When I first did so, I got an out of office reply from AGE customer services.

So good, as long as it doesn't break down, otherwise, you've thrown your money away.",Rejected
"I purchased KM4100 mixer because it looked good on the website. It was dispatched from Germany. I assumed that it was made in Germany (AEG is a German company, I think!). When it arrived i was very happy, it looked good, very heavy. The only concern was the ""made in China label"". The mixer was used about 10 times from October 2017 to June 2018, it worked very well! Until June 19th when it would not switch on, tested fuse which was OK. Called the service number on the AEG website, given another number to call. Called that number. told ""we only repair white goods"" given another number. Called that number eventally got through to ""PERSON"" he wanted me to send him a video of me trying to operate the faulty mixer! Enough said.....",Approved

I really love this cooker and have read the manual and refer to it daily at the moment to achieve the best results.

"This oven is not a combination microwave . it does not combine microwave cooking with fan oven or grill. It works ok as a fan oven & grill but the microwave function cooks very unevenly & can only operate at 600w if combined manually with the other functions so it is no good for quick cooking of baked potatoes or meat.
I have an american combi microwave on my boat & it is superb cooking very quickly with excellent results.
I have had been very satisfied with aeg products before but I wish I had never bought this one.",Approved
"Looks great - good quality. Had a gas appliance before so this is taking a bit of getting used to but having read the manual it's not difficult to use. Functions are clearly marked. Good sized ovens. The more I use it the more I like it. Rated it 4-star as I haven't had the cooker long enough to check out all functions, otherwise would have given it 5.",Approved
"We bought the combi microwave/oven 15 months ago along with a number of other appliances for a house renovation. We're very pleased with the functions and the design of the combi oven but were surprised to have to call out an engineer to resolve a 'steamed up' door which then developed heavy condensation. The customer service contact process was tedious, however, when the engineer came he was very efficient and quickly replaced the offending part (the seal on the glass had failed) suggesting that it was a known problem. Other than this we're very happy with this and all the other appliances we bought.",Approved

turn knob back to off

Cooking and microwave is great. Not used all functions yet. Easy to clean",Approved
"There is a button in the middle of the timing controls that if pressed starts the microwave. This works even when the oven is on fan oven mode, so if you press it by mistake when setting the timer for the fan oven your food will be cremated. This is not an ideal design. 
The manual is not that clear either. I had to spend a long time trying to work out if the baking tray and rack supplied could be left in the microwave when using it. They can't.",Approved

"We were very unhappy with the dishwasher that had come with our new kitchen and we saw an advert for this one. Although it was quite a bit more expensive we realise that you get what you pay for. The feature of the bottom tray that raises up was the reason we decided to go for it. It's just great, also I love the 30 minute wash which is normally enough for any items. It means that I will put the dishwasher load on even if it's not full so at least I can keep things clean and the dishwasher empty for a larger load if needed. I love the way the door opens to expel the steam at the end of the cycle, no more dripping plates etc. I cannot think of anything negative to say about this machine.",Approved
I recommend the product. It works perfectly and i am very satisfatied.,Approved
oven seems to work well but we are a bit disappointed with the lack of information on how to use its many functions in a simple way/format - no information that we could find on AEG website or indeed anywhere on the web. It would be a great help to us to have a easy to understand cookbook for this oven!,Approved
Very nice machine with lots of exceptionally good features. Particularly like the rubber inserts for placing glasses. The cutlery box however takes up far too much space and a tray system would be preferable.,Approved
Very easy to use and produces great food. I was worried it would be complicated but it wasn't. Great features and food comes out perfectly cooked. Love the Microwave function. Saves having a seperate microwave and also matches tge main oven. Would recommend to anyone.,Approved
This freezer is just the right size for our kitchen we struggled to buy one the right depth but this fit the bill. The door is hard to open but suspect this is for a reason so we are very happy with it.

With a reputable brand such as AEG I expected much better for the price and given that our previous Hotpoint machine soldiered on for 6 years with no issues getting the same usuage, i am dissapointed to say the least.

"My machine is under 2 years old and is already broken. At the best I will need to replace the pump which appears to work only intermittently, perhaps the control board, or perhaps throw it out.
I do not expect to pay for a premium brand washing machine to have it this badly broken at under 2 years of reasonably light domestic use. I certainly don't expect to have my review removed because it isn't positive when the experience is so poor.
I also didn't appreciate the 'I dont care it is out of guarantee' response to the situation.
If the review parts of this page are to be useful they must include the bad. If it were even more useful then AEG would read them and correct the problem - maybe turning a bad experience into a good one.
And yes, basic checks for blockages, clean filter, straight pipes etc. have been done. The pump simply doesn't turn on every occasion it is required to. Flicking the impeller helps... but not when the machine is full of water.",Rejected
My first purchase was replaced (with no quibble) under guarantee after 9 months limited use. It would neither charge nor start.. The immediate replacement has now also given up the ghost in a similar time span.. Most disappointing considering this cleaner was used as an alternative to my Electrolux Wessex+ cleaner and was not overused in any way. Replacement batteries are expensive and I would not recommend this cleaner in the light of its obvious short trouble-free lifespan. Sorry.,Approved
"We spent quite some time in the store going through our requirements for our new dishwasher, after having had our previous model for some 15 years.

There's quite a lot of motor whine at slower spin speeds, whereas my previous machine was almost silent. The drain pump that's connected to the kitchen sink is fairly quiet. It's also quite annoying that when the drying time is finished it beeps at you but it's a few minutes until the door will unlock. Overall it's better equipped than the machine it replaces, if a little noisier and slightly more complicated Hopefully it will last a long time.",Approved

The glass finish is perfect although it doesn't allow for glasses with tall stems so some need to be placed on bottom rack.  the cutlery tray is good use of space, can leave marks on cutlery but mostly really good. The main reason I purchased was the comfort lift draw, really beneficial to those with bad backs.   The soft spikes is an excellent design. Love how quiet this machine is!

So even though there was no problem at all with the other machine with regards to leakage they must have split the pipe but wouldnt own up to it, even though the original guys were nice and friend!y.

Almost 3 weeks ago the AEG stopped turning on. I sent it to the local dealer workshop and he informed me that the front control panel was malfunctioning and needs to be replaced, and the one year warranty had expired.

Very pleased with new oven. Haven’t used all features as yet but cooks evenly and very quickly. Looks great too.,Approved
A nice simple and largely intuitive control panel and a choice of six cooking zones make this a great choice for oldies like us. Separate heat increase and decrease keys for each zone are especially welcome and infinitely superior to the alternative of selecting the zone and using a shared heat control often of the swipe variety which lacks precision. This is a fine replacement for a very simple near 30 year old traditional style of electric hob. The Automatic Heat Up function is very useful.,Approved
Great job - really like individual temp controls for each hot plate. Intuitive to use. Power boost for each plate too - heats up water really fast.,Approved

"Having used this hob for about a week now I am loving it. It is very quick to heat up and it is not like an electric hob, It is very sensitive and you can control the temperature, better than gas I would say. It boils a huge pot of water really quickly. I haven't timed it but there's no waiting around for long periods of time.

I don't have a matching hood so can't try out the wireless features but I love the timer feature which allows me to set my food to cook for a set amount of time and then automatically turns off. It means that I don't have to be constantly standing over it. 

Not only does it look great, but it also works really well and most of all for me is super easy to clean.",Approved

My major disappointment is not having the option of 50 deg C for loads that you want warm water, but 60 is too hot for the fabric. Spin speed at 1400 rpm leaves the clothes dry, but badly creased. I stick to 1200 for now in summer but the 1400 option might be very useful in winter and the resulting ironing will keep me warm!",Approved

The freezer makes a little more noise than we expected but we hardly have anything in the freezer at the moment. Overall we are happy with the product. The price was very good and although not the cheapest it is not the dearest (a NEFF freezer is around 40% more expensive).

We had an AEG oven and microwave for over 9 years and had no issues at all.",Approved
"Bought this last year to replace worn out Hotpoint, which had worked well up until it's demise. Needed an integrated machine to blend into my kitchen. Apart from being very noisy on spin - and when I say noisy I mean noisy - the filter is actually located beneath the plinth, so I have had to remove half of my kitchen plinth in order to access it??!! Again I repeat ""Built in?"" I can only wonder what the engineers who design these machines were thinking of!!

Don't buy if you have an in-built kitchen!!",Approved

This machine has good looks and build quality but the washing performance is not as good as the 15 year old machine it replaced (OKO-LAVAMAT 76689) This machine tangles the clothes.,Approved
"All cycles tried have given good wash results and the machine runs quietly and smoothly.
The large door and drum make loading very easy.
The 20minute wash is very useful for a quick small load, especially when in a hurry.
Another good feature is the time save button which can cut down the washing time on other cycles considerably.
Very pleased with the machine in the few weeks it has been used and I actually look forward to doing the washing!",Approved
The AEG washing machine is a quality product. It washes well.,Approved
"I had an AEG washing machine before, it was still going after 12 years when we moved house so I definitely wanted another one. 

We tend to do many small washes rather than one large load. The new AEG machine is great for this as it's got a sensor that detects how much clothing I've put in. It then adjusts the wash time and the display tells me when it'll be finished. It also has a huge drum which comfortably took a double duvet.

That combined with the fact it's so quiet and easy to use means I'm even happier with this one than my old machine that lasted me 12 years!",Rejected
"New kitchen meant a replacement for our old Miele. This was the best we could find. Nice large drum, good range of programmes, works well. Noisy on top spin but I have found that with all washing machines",Approved
All programs are very well done. Clothes are looking like a brand new after every wash!,Approved
First time I have bought an AEG product and it is by far the best washing machine I’ve ever purchased.Nice quiet machine and the time saver button is an excellent feature.,Approved
"ello, unfortunately the purchased AEG L6FB48C washing machine turned out to be faulty on the first day. In the centrifuge the washing machine jumped and shifted. I filed a complaint with the ZORA trader from where I purchased it, but refused to change it unfortunately. I am completely disappointed with the washing machine, and I am a customer of the AEG for 20 years. I'm going to buy a whole new furniture with new electric appliances. I have tremendous worries.",Approved
Only just using after cooking with Halogen. Although it has plenty of excellent design features induction cooking using this hob isn't cooking as what I had hoped from my research.,Approved
Good quality build. Add the option functions to the standard  pre-set  programmes and you are spoilt for choice. Its a washing machine that washes clothes brilliantly clean. No fuss. No drama. Its a AEG.,Approved
This product is quite and washes well however I think it could be improved by having a quick wash cucle,Approved
"Wow.
When we purchased this induction hob for our new kitchen I was unsure about these 'New Fangled' appliances. After all I'm 74 years old and find the latest gadgets sometimes difficult to fathom.
I needn't have worried. The comprehensive guide, supplied with the hob, took me from the initial turning on stage through the many different programmes possible in a simple, easy to understand way that even I could understand. With my new pots and pans I now can cook safely and economically and with its modern ergonomic lines this hob is a main feature of our kitchen. Thank you.",Approved
"I had always preferred gas, but had lived with a standard ceramic electric hob for years, bring on the AEG induction hob! WOW this transforms cooking, the immediacy of gas but without the flame, without the burnt on overspills, why didn't we get one of these before?
The hob looks great when off, great when on, and is easy to use with good safety features. If you are thinking about AEG induction, jump right in, it really is great!",Approved
"There were three suitable machines, but i decided on the cheapest one as we didn't need bigger capacity than what it offers. So far, I've not been disappointed. It functions brilliantly, and is very quiet. 1400 spin is very very quiet, this machine is so well balanced even with big towels mixed with small items. As a criticism, this machine looks like a budget model. It doesn't have the stylish look of other more expensive machines - fine for my utility room though.",Approved
"Installed 18mnths ago immediate problem with one of the burners not igniting. Called out engineer who said ""oh yes sometimes this happens Just need to insert a piece of tissue!!!"" So for an appliance costing in excess of £300 all it took,was a piece of tissue!! Now I've to call them out again as ignition won't always go off. Cleaning is a nightmare, if you don't get to clean some of the marks off the glass it seems to etch into the glass and is impossible to shift! Not a happy bunny!!!",Rejected
best product ever...billy mays says so! You have to believe him right~!??!!,Approved
have you ever seen a product do this??? certainly not!,Approved
"Hon works really well, in fact it’s so efficient it can sometimes be too powerful but using the wok attachment solves this. Easy to clean. Really pleased.",Approved
"I am very pleased with this purchase. The air conditioner is very efficient and cools the room down very quickly. The humidity goes almost immediately. The outlet pipe cleverly is oblong shaped and fits snugly when trapped beneath a sash window. It is not as noisy as I expected and when the room gets down to temperature, is barely audible. A great machine, sensibly priced.",Approved
I'm not using it very long but just a month however haven't encounter any difficulties with this hob. Easy to operate and clean. A lot of space for cooking.,Approved
"This has gone far than i expected. A bit hesitant first because of its price but gave it a go as AEG has established itself as a great manufacturer of quality products. 
Operation wise, it is very straight forward. Used it straight out of the box. The style is so clean and sophisticated, can definitely be placed on anyones room regardless of room design. Nice and sturdy and well built.
And the most important of it all very cost effective.
It does the job perfectly, cooling a room quietly in no time at all.",Approved
"Product has great features however is quite noisy, item itself is great , good features good time management and low electric usage",Approved

We usually opt for Bosch however upon recommendation we purchased an AEG for a lower price. So glad we purchased this washing machine. It’s pretty much silent when running. The drum size is great with features to match. Would definitely recommend.,Approved
I couldn’t have chosen a better machine. Big drum and not so deep,Approved
"A great hob that functions far better than a previous Bosch product. The touch interface is also good, responding accurately and better than other products I've used.",Approved

This hob was all I expected it to be coming from AEG. It cost more than my previous Induction hob but is well worth the extra.,Approved
"I bought the AEG induction Hob to replace a one year old solid plate electric hob that broke down on Christmas Day in the middle of cooking Christmas dinner. The hob is easy to clean, fast to respond, and such a neat design . The model I chose was very affordable, and arrived a day or two after ordering.most of my pans were Stellar ones and suitable for the new hob too. Best decision of 2018 so far.",Approved
"We purchased this product after a disastrous two years with another well known brand, so to find a cooker that does what it's meant to, is quite a revelation. The build quality is sturdy and well finished. The doors fit well and all the controls are well placed and easy to use. The hob has five different sized rings (one being a double ring) so there's plenty of choice for pan sizes. Each ring has 9 heat settings instead of the usual six, giving a very controllable range of heat from boil to simmer. My only gripe is the lip along the front edge, above the knobs. It makes us difficult to clean off spilt foods, crumbs etc. The two ovens are a good size and three shelves are supplied along with a very large grill /roasting pan. The main oven can be used as conventional oven or a fan oven. The fan has its own heating element, so shelf positions are not critical. It can also be used as a second grill, but with the door shut, American style. I can't get used to that idea. The instruction manual is poorly written and quite confusing. It's probably helpful to visit some AEG forums if you have any questions about its operations. Cooking results are excellent. Cakes are nice and even, meat is beautifully roasted and yorkies come up huge. We have a large family descend on us every other week for Sunday lunch and this cooker handled the quantities well. This is the most expensive cooker we've ever purchased but it is vastly superior to our last one. Accordingly I can't really comment on value for money, but it certainly seems that you get what you pay for. Overall, I've scored it 4/5. It's great but it's not perfect.",Approved
"Very pleased with our new induction hob, very responsive when changing heat setting. Amazingly quick to boil. Looks great and has converted me from gas.",Approved
we had to buy a new oven due to ceramic hob getting smashed indesit make looked to upgrade without spending silly money quick and easy purchase from john lewis oven work well and looks good,Rejected
"Washes brilliantly, didn’t realise how inferior my previous washing machines were. Good choice of programmes. Wool wash leaves far too much water in wool, maybe I have to action a spin at end of cycle? Noiser at spin than I was expecting which is a little disappointing. Great, large door opening making keeping the seals clean easier.",Approved
Excellent product i would like to buy from aeg always their products,Rejected
This machine washes well. I was afraid it would not because of the water saving technology but it does clean well. I wish I could tell it to use more water though. Good Warranty.,Approved
Extremely pleased with this cooker. Love the fan oven and glass lid.,Approved
Quick and easy to use just like a gas hob. Good experience to date.,Approved
Nice looking model. Fan a bit noisy after oven turned off. Easy to use.,Approved
"I am extremely pleased with my new washing machine - it is very quiet and the clothes are both clean and almost crease free.
My only minor grumble is the cycle lengths - some are very long - however there is a quick 20 minute cycle for clothes that are not grubby which seems ok. I would recommend this machine - good value and seems very well built.",Approved

THIS HOB IS FANTASTIC SO EASY TO CLEAN AFTER ANY SPILLS AND JUST LOOKS FABULOUS IN THE NEW KITCHEN,Approved
"Very pleased with product, both in appearance and operation. It looks very modern and the thin glass design suits the worktop well. The controls are easy to use and I have no problems with them.
Note: If you are upgrading from a traditional ceramic or halogen hob, you will require suitable saucepans/cookware that are compatible with these later type Induction hobs.",Approved
This is a very user friendly induction hob. Just wipes clean with a damp cloth though you do need to dry it off with a paper towel to avoid smears,Approved
We can’t believe how well this hob works boils water in no time at all and didn’t take very long to get used to,Approved
I'd recommend this product. It's ease of use and flexibility iso excellent. The hob to hood feature is great.,Approved
"The hob seems to be pretty good in terms of heat, I’m still getting used to the controls and not sure yet if it’s my big fingers or the controls are too crowded. I would advise trying the controls before buying but overall I think we made a good choice.",Approved
This is my first induction hob having recently moved away from a ceramic hob with knobs. The hob is fast and efficient and so easy to clean with its smooth top. I would highly recommend.,Approved
The revamped control panel is so much clearer and easier to use. The ease to increase/decrease the power levels is so important for induction and half increments are most welcomed. The bevelled edge gives it a quality look and feel.  Our next upgrade will be a new hood as the hobs ‘hob2hood’ feature automatically controls the two saving time and messy finger marks. Top marks AEG.,Approved
However scratched after only 4 or 5 uses and have no idea how as I have been extremely careful and new pans with no rough edges,Approved
"I would have prefered two small rings , but i do love the hob",Approved
"With no experience of induction hobs before purchasing mine I was really surprised with the functions available. The fact that I can now leave my rice, vegetable etc 'in safe hands' ie on timer and walk away from the kitchen was a revelation. My hob looks good, is efficient and easy to keep clean. Win win for me.",Approved
I am really impressed with he quality of this machine. It is so quiet even when spinning. There are a wide range of programmes available to suit everyones needs. The drum is also huge which is good for duvets and large garments.,Approved
"Broke after two weeks of use. AEG very slow to fix. Currently waiting for third engineer to come and try to fix it even though second one said it needs to be completely replaced.

Does not bode well for the future.",Approved
"Moving from a Halogen hob to this Induction hob has been a  very successful transition the new hob is so much more responsive, pans heat so much faster and when you turn it down its pretty much instant.  No more boiling over! the Hob looks good and very easy to clean.  

The controls are very easy to use and are quite intuitive and quick to respond.  Just getting used to the  buzzing, clicks and fans whirring while hob is working., which is a new experience coming from a hob that was pretty much silent.

I have noticed that some of our pans which say they are suitable for Induction (Tefal Jamie Oliver pans) are quite slow to heat when compared to other pans  so choose your pans carefully.",Approved
"I bought this machine because I liked the idea of the detachable water tank for ease of filling and the specifications seemed to match my needs. however, my dislikes of it are: I can't get the coffee to the strength I like, the beeps to denote the end of the brewing process happen before it has finished brewing, the time display doesn't remain on, when not in use, the glass water container has water all over it and looks a mess, the instruction booklet is next to useless. I wish I could return it but don't suppose I have a valid reason. I would welcome feedback from AEG",Approved
"Fault appeared just before I had had this appliance 12-months.... engineer came out and fitted replacement main PCB - everything ended up Italian and could not be changed, now waiting for a further part which I know will not make any difference (this has happened with my previous integrated coffee machine), so am waiting yet another week for this - when I know it will have to be replaced …..Stop making domestic integrated coffee machines if they are not fit for purpose! 

This isn't some cheap and nasty appliance - paid almost £1K for this machine, expected it to last longer than 11 months / 2 weeks ??",Approved
"I decided to replace my existing ceramic hob recently. As a caterer, I get to work in a number of kitchens within customer's houses and I have always been impressed by the performance of induction jobs. AEG had always stood out so when I went shopping, it was an easy decision as to which brand I would use. This particular model has some super features that assist me in both work and play which make it a real pleasure to use.",Approved
"Microwave function useless, oven is good with more functions that you could ever use. I bought this as a back up for my main oven but was a complete waste of money and a straight forward microwave would have been better. If you use the oven feature it takes ages for the very noisy fan to stop running when you switch if off. When you microwave something the fan doesn't run long enough so it remains steamed up and you have to leave the door open or wipe it dry every time you use it.

The microwave part is the only bit I regularly use but it stopped working just outside of the 2 year guarantee so will cost over £100 to repair.",Rejected
"The product is great quality with plenty of cooking options, excellent!",Approved
"Very quick to heat up, lots of different features. Pyrolysis needs to be more clear that everything including rack mounts need to come out.",Approved
"This is a well-built fridge freezer with lots of good features. It is taller than my previous one, but a little narrower. The fridge compartment is taller - making it ideal in this respect. However, the freezer compartment is a little smaller, so you have to remember this when shopping.",Approved
"I have had this machine for just over a year and compared to our previous three washing machines, this one has given the most trouble - in fact, much more trouble. The main problem is that it keeps tripping the Earth Leakage circuit breaker. We don't even use the cotton/linen 90-degree wash otherwise the steam would make this nuisance tripping much worse. We have spent 50 to 70 pounds using the public laundrette in the high street, not to mention the enormous inconvenience. Keeping the washing machine door normally open (when not in use) will help since it will dry out the internal moisture, but now we have got to the stage where even that solution has stopped working....I will be calling the AEG Service staff shortly. I did call them four months ago but later cancelled the appointment since I managed
to get the machine working by keeping the door open for a couple of days.",Approved
"In over 20 years of buying and using electrical appliances, this is the worst.  For the price I would expect top quality and top functionality.  Neither can be said.  
After 15 months, the machine broke down, three visits later we were eventually left with a working appliance.  Fast forward 4 months and we again have a faulty appliance.  A machine half the price would have last longer.  I have now given up and am buying a cheaper appliance with way more functionality.  This does not have sensor drying, has a really annoying time indicator which just beeps and stays at 0 for ages before letting you do anything, I could go on...  Do not buy at any cost, you have been warned.  If you do, then take out the extended warranty as you will need regular engineer visits.",Approved
"This oven does not disappoint. Once you get used to it, its very easy to use, there are lots of cooking options and I like the fact that you can preheat the oven quickly. I have cooked various items in the oven now such as Roast Chicken, Pasta Bakes, fresh pizza and they all cooked perfectly.",Approved
So far so good just hope it lasts as long as my old one.,Approved
"Really happy with machine, good wash programs and quiet when on",Approved
"Lots of different options to choose from, great results.",Approved
"Only changed to this machine as new kitchen required integrated appliances, I was a little worried this would not be as good as my old Bosch but no problem, its better, would recommend",Approved
"It knocks spots off my previous induction hob. I love the bridging facility, and the stainless steel surround stops dirt getting under edges. It's so easy to use, and very quick. I've tried the stop and go facility - and it worked perfectly! Can't find anything to grumble about :))",Approved
Catch your fingers when opening and closing the door otherwise ok,Approved
The only difficulty so far is the choosing / reading of the symbols on the dial button. For older eyes the symbols are difficult and the location of the symbols is difficult.,Approved
"I had a similar electralux machine for years always happy . New kitchen new machine. perfect so far easy to use, results great . Quiet . Love the feature to reduce wash times.",Approved
"The wide temperature range and uniformity of heat distribution are impressive, as is the insulation. It's the first time I've been able to select top heat, bottom heat, fan or moisture. So far, this has helped improve most dishes but particularly pizzas, bread and gratins. 
I didn't think we would use the defrost setting although I have used it for gently thawing out a piece of frozen salmon and proving bread with excellent results. The bread that has been proved at 30 deg C and baked at 220 with steam is irresistible, crisp crust with full flavour moist interior.
Grilling, especially with turbo fan, has produced excellent results. The illuminated view makes it very easy to judge the progress of cooking without opening the door. 
The flexibility of the timer is useful, programmed to switch on and off or just to confirm cooking time. I still need to refer to the instruction manual at the moment but I'm sure it will become easier.
The oven is supplied with two shelves although large iron casseroles are best used on the grill pan as the wire shelves tend to bend under the weight. The low temperature control facilitates the slow cooking of meat, perfect for producing some tender and fully flavoured dishes.

We haven't used all of the settings yet, the choice opens the possibility of perfect cooking in a wide range of styles, we are still experimenting and enjoying the results. Sadly, the first oven we received had a fault out of the box, (on the left hand button) and had to be returned. The replacement worked as expected but obviously thoughts of reliability are influenced by that experience.",Approved
"Although I have had this appliance for about a month now, I am pleased with the design and efficiency. I just hope that is also durable and will last for a number of years without any problems.",Approved
"Great machine, may be on the small side for a large family (7kg) but fine for what I want. Enough programmes and very easy to use.",Approved
Design fault causing very loud spin within two years of buying. It’s an expensive washing machine for this to happen so quickly. I definitely wouldn’t recommend this product.,Approved
cleans your clothes well enough but leaves a lot of fluff on the clothes after the wash is over.,Approved
After three years and two months we have been told this washer dryer is beyond economic repair.  Since owning this machine three times we have had to call out an engineer to fix the dryer.  Recently the wash cycle on 30 degrees has shrunk expensive work shirts.  Really thought  AEG would manufacture and deliver a machine to match its premium brand reputation.,Approved
Have been given 2 years cover for breakdown which is good. Was let down by my previous washer(Samsung) only lasted 4 years. I hope this will last a bit longer than 4 years. AEG is a lovely washer and very silent happy so far.,Approved
"we have had this cooker for less than a month and have had the engineers out 3 times. The hob controls were faulty from new. we now have a new hob which works perfectly. The service we received from the engineers was great, however, we expected an expensive new cooker to work.
We are very pleased it has a 5 year guarantee.",Approved
"A really nice product, that did everything I expected it to do.",Approved
"Great washing machine, easy operation, low noise x",Approved
"Does a good job. I like the fact that this machine weighs the laundry and adjusts the washing time accordingly. Reasonably quiet even at top spin speed.The buzzer is a useful addition to inform you that the cycle is completed, though my husband did wonder what was going on! No complaints: so far a good washing experience.",Approved
I am very happy with the machine. It is very good for large or small washes. The overall length of time for the 2 programmes I frequently use are much shorter than my previous machine. Overall I would fully recommend this machine.,Approved
"Love ny new machine 
Looks great and has every settling you would need . Very happy. 5 year guarantee is an extra bonus",Approved
"Cooker is great I hope it last as long as the last one 
We had that for twenty years",Approved
"I bought this wanting something light to carry but powerful enough to pick up the heaviest of indoors dirt. I was not let down, it is very light and is easy to carry up and down stairs and it picks up every kind of dirt that the house can throw at it. The only downside that I can find with it is that the charge only lasts for about 20 minutes and not the 35 that the product description claims.",Approved
I am delighted with my purchase. Light easy to use easy to take apart and reassemble. The best feature that I've not seen on other machines is the lights to show up dark corners and under furniture. An excellent product at a very good price,Approved
"This machine washes really well. An excellent all rounder. The only reason I gave it 4 stars on features is that the programmes are quite long, but easily shortened on the time save button. The 8kg drum is magic after having a 7kg one. We are doing less washing, so its economic. I think its very quiet, the only real noise you can hear is right at the top of the spin cycle. Love it !!!",Approved
This product was so good 3 members of my family purchased them. Thank you very much.,Approved
"Very happy with this product, very light, compact and easy to use.",Approved
I would recommend this product to my family and friends it is good value for the money a quite and efficient product would have liked my free item when I purchased the washing machine over all rating excellent.,Approved
"ease of use, as i am disabled and cant use heavy uprights , i find that this product is very good to use and handle and it come apart to clean it easily, i love it.",Approved
This machine has transformed the way we clean up after each meal everyone wants to do the floor and no more dog hair great attachment for stairs and car don't know how we got on without it,Approved
Using this upright now for several weeks. It is very easy to use and very easy to clean. It's detachable hand held is great for stairs chairs and the car.,Approved
My wife has struggled more and more with heavy vacuum cleaners as she has got older (and me occasionally). This one is light and powerful and very easy for her to use in almost all situations and is good with pet hair. Very useful to use outside for the car as well - sadly my job.,Approved
So quiet compared to my old washing machine. The drum size is fantastic and it is easier to get the bulkiest load in with the large door opening. Cleans perfectly and the washes can be reduced in time if you do not want to wait.,Approved
"The product has performed excellently, no problems whatsoever, it would be useful to have instruction in English rather than Spanish",Approved
"My wife and daughter suffer with back problem and find hoovering difficult. Now they can help me :-) the hoover has a great lightweight design. Only thing I would like is an extra piece to make hoovering the car easier, although this hoover is fantastic, recommending to all my family and friends to buy.",Approved
Our AEG washer has excellent design features and its economical depth measurement allows it to fit snugly under the worktop in the kitchen as required (the last one did not). The controls are easy to understand even without consulting the instructions and all of the programs are suited to our needs. We're delighted with its performance and would recommend it without reservation as it's the best washer we've ever bought since 1972 when we were married.,Approved
Makes great coffee and many many types/flavours to choose from,Approved
"First time with induction hobs, very impressed with the speed of heat and the control of heat. Like the way a spill can be wiped away from the hob because it's not very hot. Ovens are both very good, much quicker to heat up to temp than our previous cooker. Absolutely love it, hob so easy to keep clean with having no knobs, all touch control.",Approved
"The hob is so easy to use and the number of settings make it very easy to control. The bridge function for large pans is a useful feature. Having two ovens is really useful, especially when you've a lot of people to cook for, and both are a decent size. We've only had our cooker a few weeks so are still getting to know all it's features, but can honestly say we love it.",Approved
"So far so good,my wife loves it but we've only had it about a fortnight so almost pointless asking for a review already",Approved
"This machine replaced an ageing Blomberg. I was very pleased with the build quality , the thoroughness of the cleaning and the low running costs",Approved
Bought as a replacement for a condenser dryer. Very happy so far - quiet operation and good drying results. Power cable could do to be a little longer to ease installation (in my situation),Approved
"Much, much better than other cordless vacuum cleaners, that I have used before. Excellent battery live with easy exchange feature. Very helpful ""head lights"" especially in dark places under table or sofa.",Approved
It's always great to find a product that makes life easier. This has made the chore of ironing less painful - I speed through the pile of laundry.,Approved
This product is very good and easy to use + not heavy,Approved
"Excellent washer-dryer. Has got quite a lot of different programs for washing and drying but not too many - just enough and you can adjust them if needed. Very easy to operate, clear display so you know what temperature, spin and etc will be used. Clever detergent feeder so you can easily pour it without use of any other measure. Very useful steam function to refresh your clothes.",Approved
The washing machine is great. I am really pleased with it,Approved
This machine takes an 8kg load of washing and a 6 kg load to be dried. What I really like is the variety of settings and the fact that you can select your drying time and settings. I have never had a washer/drier before but this is one of the best as far as I am concerned. I find it really easy to use and keep clean as the filter is on the front.,Approved
"The shelves aren't great as they have a little lip so things get caught on them. Also the over doesn't cook evenly on fan, the front doesn't cook and the back is burnt. Not sure if teething troubles but not overly impressed.",Approved
"New extractor came with the new kitchen October last year 1/2 the bits were missing. 2nd one came and was fitted, worked OK until Christmas eve then it packed up. Called repair team just after Christmas engineer came out said we needed a new one. It's now the end of January 2018 and we are still waiting",Approved

"Having used the free standing cooker for 3 months it has performed as expected with no issues whatsoever once you get used to the oven placing / temperatures.
Having researched a little before purchase we pretty much knew what to expect ( no grill pan handle and lack of grill regulator), so have not been disappointed with the cooker, HOWEVER..... the invitation to review and be entered into a prize draw is disappointing as the draw closing date was 2 months ago!!!",Approved
Looks good but oven knobs are difficult unless 6ft tall,Approved
Disappointed can't use both ovens simultaneously as my old oven. Difficult to see how food is doing on top grill. Touch controls take some getting used to. Clock losing time. Despite these niggles cooks very well.,Approved
"Fan oven in both ovens. Self clean panels. 
Looks great.",Approved
"We have been delighted with the results so far from this well designed and quality double oven. We especially like the fan in the smaller oven which, as well as saving energy, suits our day to day cooking needs, with the larger oven used for when the family comes around.",Approved
"Beautiful aesthetics, and great performance with very quick heating. we notice an exponential increase in performance over our prior 10 year old Bosch appliance - thank you AEG!",Approved

One of the largest ‘standard’ size freezers I could find. Super efficient and relatively quiet (noisier than its matching fridge). Good mix of drawers and fixed shelves but could do with an internal light.,Approved
"This is a high quality washing machine with steam cleaning . Easy to operate with some wonderful functions such as steam cleaning, duvet and wool cycle which are outstanding. The only negative is that the setup instructions are not very clear or helpful. I would suggest YouTube videos be posted for the setup of the washing machine.",Approved
"The temperature and settings etc are written on the knobs, so they are difficult to read, especially if you are less than 6 feet tall. That is a bit annoying as the icons for defrost and heat are very similar and I have mistaken them a few times already.",Approved
Only had it 3 days and it was condemned by the engineer and needed replacing,Approved
Excellent product and excellent and quick installation of cooker with no hassle,Approved
"Excellent oven, lots of space and good even baking performance. Burners are great, especially the wok burner. It’s a little easy to turn the controls when, for example, cleaning the cooker and the grill pan has no handle.",Approved
"Machine is excellent, although I emailed tech support 2 weeks ago and to date have not had a reply. Product is excellent, support not so good.",Approved
Easy to install. Good product and customer service. Big main oven and useful top one with grill,Approved
"I needed to replace a cooker that we had for only 4 years as it was poor quality and stopped working. Because of that I did a lot of research and I haven’t been disappointed. The ovens cook well, the rings heat up very quickly and the two grills are very useful. The top oven is very big so I haven’t used the main oven quite so much. Great cooker.",Approved
Great product at a great price. Good build quality and lots of features,Approved
Great model for a freeezer offering all necessary requirements,Approved
Really good freezer loads of room fits nicely in a 600 unit.,Approved
Great freezer especially love the 30 min timer. Lots of sensible compartments.,Approved
Every ones loves it easy to use good lights in side,Approved
This oven is very powerful and the actual cooking times on food products are now actually accurate. My only minor complaint is that the front knobs are plastic and are wobbly - which impacts your assessment of this being a high quality product. Ditch the plastic and it’ll come across as better.,Approved

"Was very sceptical about going over to induction cooking, I had nothing to worry about. It’s easy to use, very fast and efficient. I am still amazed at how fast it comes to boiling.

No Grill pan handle!!!!!!!
Oven panel coatings....the powder coating wearing off when trays (shelves) are slid in and out.....leaves brown dust and looks very unsightly...very irritating!!!!!!",Approved

"Great washing machine. Washes well, is quiet and can fit a lot of washing in.",Approved
"Looks absolutely stunning in my new kitchen and blends seemlessly into the black sparkle granite worktops. I bought this hob for the sleek design and its power capacity and it excels in both, the speed which it boils water at is quite unbelievable, also searing steaks in a red hot cast iron pan is a breeze, it makes my gas powered range that it replaced seem like something from the dark ages.",Approved
I am so pleased with this washing machine. It’s design is stunning. The programmes are easy to use and the washing comes out really clean.,Approved
Very good washing machine with a useful range of different features. Very efficient yet quiet spin and I like the way that it changes the length of the programme depending on the load. Large door makes loading and unloading easy. Very impressed so far.,Approved
"Selection of programme is a bit confusing. 
Indicated time is completely misleading, says 4 hours for a wash, does it in less. But at least it's not more.",Approved
"This is a good washing machine. Washes well and I like the salt aspect to care for clothes from hard water. I have also recently tried another top machine. In comparison the aeg is louder, bit not annoyingly so and the cycles take ages!.",Approved
"The large drum capacity means I am able to complete my weekly wash far quicker than previously and my washing products seem to last longer.
It’s simple to use, has a wide range of useful programs and operates so quietly I used to have to check it was on.
It looks good and it washes everything so well I’m planning to buy the matching tumble dryer very soon.",Approved
"The power control is great but I find I can only use it with liquid in the pan and can scorch the glass.
The unit is great to clean and I previously cooked with gas. Looks great, cleans great cooks fast and accurate",Approved
At present the hob is waiting to be installed with our new kitchen. But before we bought it we were able to try it and were so impressed we are going away from a gas hob for the first time since we moved in together 39 years ago!,Approved
I have a 5 ring I induction electric hob. It heats up within seconds & is very easy to keep clean. I am delighted with this product & would definitely recommended this AEG product,Approved
"I find my new oven to be quite technical to use, but am getting used to the functions. I especially like the steam and partial steam baking functions, but have not yet used all the programmes",Approved
"Awesome cooker. Totally amazed at the speed a pan of water will boil. I love this cooker! Induction hobs are far hotter than helogen for sure. Its more like using gas.
The only negative thing i can think of is the top oven is 20 degrees or so cooler than the display, now i know this it isnt a problem.
Easy to use, easy to clean.",Approved
The vacuum cleaner is going like a boeing !!! the best on the market when suction power is taken into consideration.,Approved
"Overall we are very happy with this machine. 

We were a little surprised at how narrow in depth the machine is. Standard width of a machine (just under 60cm) but drum is not as deep. However, it is supposed to take 8kgs rather than our previous 7kgs - not tried a duvet in it yet, so we will see.

Regardless of that, it appears well built and is much quieter than our previous Hotpoint machine.",Approved
If this is anything like the previous model 493321-MN frankly I wouldn't bother. Disappointed with AEG as well,Rejected
Have been a devotee of these for years this generation is the greatest.,Approved
"excellent appliance, seems efficient and of a good design",Approved

"Purchased this product following loads of research at the same time we purchased the dual fuel induction hob. We ordered through a local AEG retailer. On the 7th September both products were collected by our kitchen fitters from the retailer, both were packaged and sealed and stored securely until the new kitchen was at a stage ready for the fitting of the appliances. 
Two weeks on they were fitted, the double oven opened only for us to find there were no shelves supplied!! Renders the oven totally useless.
We contacted the retailer immediately who in turn contacted AEG who have basically said we are all liars. They have accepted no liability whatsoever and offered no explanation. I have called AEG to be told the systems are down and they are unable to take calls at present. I have today emailed customer care and await a response.  The oven as it is, is not fit for purpose. I look forward to a response from the manufacturer as soon as possible",Approved
So pleased with this oven. We wanted an eye level double oven and this really fits the bill. Both ovens work in exactly tha same way so you can grill in either oven. Both are also fan ovens so ideal for cooking for large numbers.,Approved
"Good looking and solidly built But could be a lot better
 NEEDS
 1.double wall...gets HOT
2. Noisy
3. Very narrow filler opening
4. Level indicator should be on the side,Not obscured by the handle
 Other features are good...but as I say can be a lot better",Approved
"There’s a design flaw with the heater/pump component. Ours has failed 3 times now. This is borne out by the engineers who are replacing them constantly. The component costs approx £190. 

However, this is completely shadowed by the dreadful customer services. 

There is an unpublished OPTION 4 on their automated telephone system. This is the only way of speaking to an AEG person. Otherwise you get fed into 0800 REPAIR (3rd party service company)",Approved

This is a nice big dishwasher that is easy to load and unload with excellent cleaning and very quiet,Approved
Great quality product with lots of choices of programs to suit all needs and a good capacity. Nice looking machine which isn’t too noisy at all. Delay start facility means washing can be done overnight on lower cost electricity. Delighted with my purchase.,Approved
A quality product at an excellent price. The coffee machine is simple to use and makes great coffee from a wide range of pods. excellent Espresso coffee. The milk frother makes a good amount of frothy milk for Cappuccinos. With temperature choice and different water volumes it has it all. We replaced a much used 3 year old Nespresso U-milk machine with the AEG and wished that we had discovered the AEG machine sooner.,Approved
My only issues with this product is that my dinner plates wont't stand up in it due to size of appliance also my cutlery doesn't fit in the holes in the cutlery basket.,Approved
I have am very pleased with my new AEG dishwasher. Having had a Miele for the last 12 years I was nervous to switch brands but am so glad I did. Very good design inside. Glass holders are very helpful and I like the way the cutlery basket can go into a different position if required. It washes brilliantly and I like the way it opens itself when finished drying.,Approved

The hob is easy to use and easy to clean. The pan stands are secure and pans are well balanced.,Approved
Love my new induction hob it is so versatile and clean to cook with. Also very economical.,Approved
Quite disappointed as we had a cheap dishwasher for tyrants and eventually broke so thought we would go for a higher end brand but unfortunately not as good as our old Prima machine. The wash is hit and miss and need to reload some items. We have turned off the open/drying feature as fills the kitchen with steam therefore the pots need drying when finished. Overall quite poor so look elsewhere,Rejected
First induction hob and must say it is quite brilliant to use. The hob heats really quickly and evenly and is very easy to clean.,Approved
Easy to use and clean. Love the power button. Good control,Approved
Super fast heat regulation and slick looks make this induction hob a great buy. Much more modern and easier on the eye than a gas hob. Easy to clean. A winner.,Approved
"Excellent gas hob, easy ignition, strong even heat, well laid out for multiple saucepans.",Approved
"My last hob was 19 years old. This has so many useful features and is a great improvement: the heat is readily controllable with a good range of hob sizes. I find the inbuilt timers particularly useful as is the swift, automatic warm up. The display gives good information and is easy to use whilst the lock facility offers peace of mind.",Approved

This refrigerator is smaller than my previous ones and was purchased to fit into the new kitchen. It is very well designed and well built giving maximum usage of the space available. Would strongly recommend this product,Approved
After reading the manual and trying to sort out how it works there is no doubt it is designed to do a very satisfactory job and papers to be quite economical.,Approved
Loving the AEG wine fridge now the kitchen is in and we are entertaining more than ever !,Approved
We have struggled to operate this Which recommended cooker. The controls are touch screen and not sufficiently sensitive.

It has timed drying for all fabrics. But I'm not sure about automatic drying?",Rejected

"This new AEG washing machine is great. It is so quiet. It washes well and has lots of useful features, including an extra steam facility which makes it less necessary to iron shirts.

We have had an AEG washer/tumble dryer for less than 3 years and had a failure in a sensor that stopped the tumble dryer from working. The cost for this repair? £195.88 with 12 month guarantee. Not very impressed with the quality of this AEG product.,Approved
"Had the fridge for 6 months not a great design with less room than my old fridge. Main dairy draw broke and fell apart very poor customer service, not really listening to the customer just fobbing off the same old comments totally unimpressed!!",Rejected
"I was a little concerned to begin with that this washing machine was a little bit more expensive than others and that its performance would be mediocre..... how wrong was I! Fab machine, I have confidence that every item I put in the wash is clean even on the 20 minute... yes you heard right .. the 20 minute fast wash! With 2 sporty young men this machine is a saviour!",Approved
"Good easy to use product, instructions being easy to understand, cooked my first cakes in the new oven to perfection",Approved
"I have never had an AEG washing machine before but once our Bosch machine died I started to look on line all the reviews pointed to AEG and when John Lewis website rave it 5 stars it was a no brainier as far as I was concerned. All the reviews are correct easy to use, wonderfully large drum, washing lovely and clean and washing comes out practically dry so less time in the tumble dryer! So very pleased and would have no hesitation in recommending oh and the machine looks good too",Approved
So quiet you forget it's on. Clothes are dried in one cycle.,Approved

I can say without a doubt that this watch is the new hotness. I always notice people staring at my wrist like I am some type of movie star or something.,Approved
Design and Quality is great but the washing cycles are just too long (hours !) and even the fast wash button only reduces this to 1.5 hrs . The 1 quick cycle includes a heated tumble dry section (which is not good for underwear with elastic) I would prefer more shorter cycles and the ability to decide when I want to tumble dry (or not),Approved
This is a great product but a bit complicated and a better user manual would be helpful but great features the Pizza cooking setting is brill,Approved

"I dithered over buying this cooker, I wanted induction; I was used to a multi function fan oven and wanted another; lots of current cookers have stupidly small shelves this didn't ; it looked good; ok it was expensive but hopefully you get what you pay for. So why the indecision, mainly the reviews of others sure there were lots of good reviews but quite a high percentage complained of electricity blowing, the induction hob needing tehnicians attention, the quality was not good enough for the money. Well I bit the bullet (there's a five year guarantee after all) and bought one before they all disappeared and I'm really pleased I did. It worked perfectly from connection and the electrics have been fine.Yes the external trim around the hob does mark easily but I reckon after a few months of use it will all blend in anyway.
An annoying feature is the beep from the hob when you clean it even when it is deactivated the instructions state it is when two sensors are touched but I still don't understand why it does it when it's off but it's not a major problem. I never recommend products as Im not qualified to state that something or someone is suitable for others requirements but I would speak favourably or highly. There may still be a few of this model available for sale so if you are thinking of buying be quick or you will miss out. Such a shame it has been discontinued.",Approved
"I am absolutely loving this cooker, my food taste better and is cooked to perfection. I have to remind myself that the oven takes just 6 mins to heat up so there is no waiting around for the oven to warm up and when the halogen is switched off the cooking just stops. When the pan of veg quickly comes to the boil on 14 I turn down to 2-3 and veg are just right, no more over-cooking the veg. I cannot say anymore but well done AEG for designing a cooker that is a delight to use and looks very smart in my kitchen.",Approved
"Looks fantastic, easy wipe clean controls vast array of functions even some you can create yourself.",Approved
In the first few weeks we have suffered from significant leaks from the reservoir and dribbling feed from the coffee spout,Approved
Brought this product to replace an ageing Candy oven. Much more internal oven space but only comes supplied with one shelf and a grill pan so purchased another shelf online. Like the fact that you can clean the inside of the oven glass door which I couldn't do on my previous oven. Also various cooking options for different recipes is a good feature.,Approved
"This is a well constructed machine which does exactly what’s “said on the tin”. It feels substantial, it is very quiet, efficient and has an excellent choice of features. I would not hesitate in recommending this machine.",Approved
"Replaced our old traditional dryer with a this, saving having a hole in the wall. This machine does what it says and has lots of options to fine tune to ones needs. Like all flexible devices there is a small learning curve to get the best out of it. Quiet, efficient and great drying.",Approved
"Great and very easy to use.
A great iron to use as it has all the features I need and is great to use over long periods when I have lots of ironing to do.",Approved
Love my new oven. Two good size ovens and large grill. Fans in both ovens and plenty of different cooking options to choose from. After cooking for years on a gas oven I was a little apprehensive in choosing electric but glad I did this oven is so much more powerful and everything so far has cooked lovely. The instruction booklet wasn't the easiest but the oven is very easy to use.,Approved
The internal trays can be configured in many way and clips that allow you to wash tall wine glasses without them breaking. The quality of the wash and shine on the glass is fantastic,Approved
"We loved this cooker as it seemed to fill the bill. Despite its expensive price we felt that a 5 year guarantee plus style and what looked excellent features were worth it. However, within 1 week of delivery we had trouble with the grill/top oven and it took ages to get through to the correct centre for our area - but, after no less than 4 lengthy phone calls to different service centres, they came and repaired it. Great, we thought but then, in less than 4 weeks from my repair, the top oven feature of the grill started turning off half way through cooking (and leaving a smell of gas) so we went through the same problem again and are now awaiting the repair man once more - and all in just two months since purchase! I do so hope they can sort it long term as I am beginning to wish we'd have looked for a cheaper cooker. So AEG, please, please, PLEASE get your act together and sort my cooker - I so want to be able to change my review to say that my problem is resolved for good and hope it lasts as long as my previous cooker - a Zanussi (18 years!).",Rejected

"The release of a jet of steam onto the back plate whilst using the ovens is obviously a new feature, which we have to say, is not ideal and could be damaging to the adjoining wall cupboards. This obviously ultimately results in lots of condensation build-up. We find that the oven (although fan) does not cook evenly. 
Also, the two rear gas rings don't appear to emit much heat even when on full. Impossible to get a rolling boil; a simmer is the best we have been able to achieve. Feel that a grill pan handle should have been supplied as standard rather than needing to purchase one. These are points that we will, I am sure, become accustomed to in time as we are relatively new users. Overall, the materials used seem to be of a high quality and the 5-year guarantee is comforting.",Approved

Bit of a story to this cooker...purchased from John Lewis in Sheffield on 25th November and was delivered the following Friday. However we didn't have the opportunity to use the induction hob until the following Monday...and we couldn't get it to work! We followed the instruction booklet and even looked on You Tube to make sure that we were following the correct procedure but we still got the E6 error code coming up. We contacted JL who advised us to get in touch with the local AEG service rep as it may need a new part!!!! So I Googled this company and to my dismay the reviews for their customer service were appalling. I did make an appointment for them to come out but my husband then went to our JL store where they arranged for a replacement cooker. All is now in working order and we are impressed with the induction hob and ovens but it was all a bit fraught for a time as it looked as thought we may be cooker less for Christmas. I know that these things to happen but was very surprised as this appliance was bought after much research and reputation.,Rejected

would of been nice to have a grill handle with it but have managed ok without",Approved
Having not had a dishwasher for several months due to building work we’ve been really spoilt given the performance of our new AEG model. We’ve put all our glasses and cutlery through and they are gleaming. Very very impressive. Our friends and family are noticing too.

During cooking, one can't avoid small splashes of cooking oil and food. The user manual suggests cleaning the supports in soapy water and, if necessary, a paste cleaner.

"This is my first new oven in 20 years and whilst I expected some improvements I can't believe how efficient and effective it is. It gets to temperature very quickly and maintains this heat too which is especially useful when keeping things warm or batch cooking. The instructions are easy to understand and the guide for cooking different food types is particularly useful for temperature, shelf height and cooking mode. The catalytic plates cut down on cleaning significantly. As its insulation is greatly improved over my older model the width of the ovens are slightly narrower but I now make so much more use out of both ovens. The top oven is especially good for cakes. 

Although not the top of the range I preferred this model as it has manual dial controls and was around £200 cheaper then the digital controlled similar AEG model. 

My primary buying point is function and reliability but I must say this looks really stylish in my newly refitted kitchen.",Approved

"Disappointing layout inside and not very versatile. Only half of one side fold down for larger items. Although it is a 12 place setting, Denby plates have to go in alternate slots so only half the amount of dinner plates fit. My previous dishwasher had a cutlery drawer and a cutlery holder with a range of size holes. This basket has all the same size holes which are not large enough to fit the handles of my forks and spoons, nor the blades of my dinner knives meaning they have to be washed by hand.

"Does exactly what it’s suppose to do and does it well.

Couple of small irritations though. Why no internal light ? The last AEG dishwasher we owned had one and it’s useful. 

The biggest irritation wasn’t from me but from the fitters. The integral cupboard door slides up and down on rails,instead of screwing directly to the dishwasher front as did the previous dishwasher. It’s awful to fit, why complicate things - the simplest solution is best! I have now had to strengthen the door front with steel bracing pieces.

We bought this oven (together with an AEG combination oven) to replace the oven in our kitchen which had been there for the last 35 years! Absolutely delighted with this one - it looks fabulous in our renovated kitchen - I love seeing inside so clearly. Just exploring the different functions - but the world is clearly my oyster. All in all i am pleased with this as it seems to be a quality product.,Approved
"Disclosure: I was selected by the manufacturer to receive this product free of charge in return for an honest impartial review.
This induction hob is a sleek and stylish addition which adds a touch of class to your kitchen. With four cooking zones it provides plenty of space for family cooking. The hob is really easy to use with responsive digital swipe controls. At times the controls can be a little over sensitive as I did find myself switching them off accidentally. It is therefore really handy to have the lock function that locks on the settings preventing this from happening.

As far as using the hob is concerned you can have a pan of cold water boiling in a matter of seconds thanks to the power surge, that can then be easily turned down to simmer and cook. I also love the stop and go function which allows you to pause cooking to deal with something else - perfect for when you are called away to answer the phone or deal with something. You can then resume cooking by pressing the button again and “unfreezing” time.

We have made delicious pasta, omelettes, pancakes as well as hearty stews and curries to name just a few of the tasty, flavoursome meals we have cooked on the hob.

The hob is also easy to wipe clean with a damp cloth followed by a dry cloth to avoid smearing. I would recommend this product wholeheartedly for its great look and brilliant cooking.",Approved
this is a fantastic product. i would buy it again. you should too.,Approved
"It is a lovely fridge freezer but because it is intergrated it is rather small, that is my only problem with it, other than that it is a really nice appliance.",Approved
"This hob does it is so flexible with an excellent choice of area on which to cook, it’s got the fast heat function which is exceedingly fast. I worried about having an induction hob as my husband has cardiac monitor in place but was very reassured by my research - so no worries at all. This hob also looks very good, it fits in in every way in our kitchen. As always with AEG you know you are using incredible quality, if I had one wish it’s that I’d bought the matching cooker hood and made use of the remote function!!",Approved

"Really smart looking machine compared to the 20year old model it was replacing. Having had an AEG Lavamat for 20 years trouble free I thought it was worth sticking to the same upgraded model.

But nothing like this AEG...it’s so quiet! We can actually have a conversation stood next to it, the build quality is very impressive compared to others we’ve had the base is sealed and they supply rubber strips that you fit on the base to aid the noise reduction.

"I have only given 2 stars to this lovely machine due to , in my opinion, a serious design oversight. All the time the dryer is running the pump motor makes a very annoying and intrusive 'zhum' 'zhum' 'zhum' as it tries to remove water from the system. I understand how the condensing dryer system works but cannot understand why it is necessary for this pump to 'zhum' 'zhum' 'zhum' all the time. There must be a very small amount of water removed from the laundry as it is dried and if it really is necessary for such a noisy pump to be activated I would have thought it could be 'zhum' zhum' zhummed' every 15 minutes or so - not for the whole 'zhum' 'zhum' 'zhum' 1 - 2 hours of the drying cycle.
Needless to say I am very sorry to have spent nearly £700 on a machine which is noisier than our old AEG of some 9 years.
The washing side of the machine is excellent but seriously flawed by the latter noise.
I would only recommend this washer/dryer if it is to be sited out of the house - perhaps garage or utility room.",Rejected

"What a coincidence, we only just started using it today 22/8/18 exactly a month from purchase because we were not sure whether we wanted to keep it or not based on the other reviews from the past but because of its 5years guarantee which is great peace of mind we decided to try it today and see whether to go ahead or not.
From our initial assessment the display looks cheap,also it takes a while for the salt componet display button to come on. And it's awkward way of trying to press both the stain/prewash and plus steam botton simotaneously to get the salt water component to turn on is annoying. 
So far, we have just been reading the manual and following the instructions about 'First-time use' page. Not sure what Star to give it yet because it's too early. 
Also too expensive for the type of display sysyem and the symbols looks cheap. It should have been better for example LG or Miele seems to be better. 
To be fair, don't get me wrong it working ok from what we can see from testing but not haven't put laundry so we will update as we go. Therefore
Overall ratings is no star yet but for the sake of posting just to be able to send the post we will give it a 3star but like I said we still haven't really enjoyed the potential it promises yet. 
We hope it lasts though for the price we had to pay at John Lewis for it just to get something that will last a lifetime or at least 10years.

Finding my way round all the features on this cooker. So far am very pleased with it and have made first lot of cakes with great success.,Approved
We received this item with a dent in the bottom of the oven where it looks like it had been dropped in transit. Not great but still works. Non the less we can’t fault the unit it self. The front with its no mechanical buttons makes it very modern. All touch buttons here. Nice screen with many options. The screen displays the target temp with bars showing you actual temp with the added bonus of displaying the current temp in degrees. The oven heats up really fast and is well thermal insulated as once switched off takes about an hour to cool down. Over all this is a great looking oven with many features.,Approved
Great Freezer - looks stylish and works well. Recommend. Only thing to consider is that the 'workings' are on the back of the freezer (they were internal on our old one) so it does not go completely back to the wall and we can see the gap behind as it isn't butted up to anything else tall.,Approved

The top shelf is very small. You can’t fit a normal sized wine glass or large glass in it. Despite adding the extra drying option the dishes/glasses/cups are still wet on top. When you put plates on the bottom rack they get caught easily on the top shelf. Disappointed overall.,Approved

Really great product. My wife is of low stature and this cleaner is very comfortable for her to use because all the weight is low down as compared to our old Dyson which was top heavy. Power is very good. So handy and easy to use. Hand held is great too. Only downside is it could do with an attachment foot for the handheld .,Approved

"I bought this initially as my other washing machine had packed in after many years . I chose this model as it had a 5 year warranty (who gives 5 years unless they know it will last is my theory! ) 

It's very well built and easy to view the buttons and choose which type of wash , Also large door to load /unload . Although others had a faster wash I have noticed my towels seem as though they have washed better than previously. 

Small light loads if Pushed for Timet (it's a 30 min wash too ) if in a hurry but I can honestly say the only issue I have is that I cannot do a spin cycle alone on fast spin unless I haven't discovered how yet , a small price to pay for what is a great washing machine from a quality brand !",Approved

Vacuuming is so easy with this light weight cordless. No restrictions and good suction. It's attractive and I love the floor standing charging base...no drilling walls.

"Well what a shock, bought to replace a cumbersome, unwieldy Vax, we simply wanted something portable. Reviews were good, and the price great. The AEG name sold it to me, its German what more do I say.
Delivered bang on time and assembled in no time, so far so good. Now the shocks, well its light and very slim so just how good is it. The answer is very, much better pick up than its predecessor and the steering is a joy after months of bumping misery. The light is an extra I was unaware of but really useful in dim corners.
The detachable hand vacuum was another unexpected bonus, good research huh, so we actually got two vacs for the price of, well a cheap one. In short its fabulous, get one.",Approved

"I had previously owned an AEG freestanding cooker with induction hob and also the AEG HK654400XB Induction Hob.  I did not hesitate to say yes when I was offered the opportunity to test and review the AEG IKB64401FB.
The hob looks very smart and has a bevelled edge.  I will admit, I do prefer the look of my previous hob which has a stainless steel edge / trim. Personally, I think this offers better protection against chipping the edges and overall gives a more finished look to the hob.

As you’d expect, an induction hob is much more efficient and responsive than a traditional electric hob.  The glass top means that it’s easy to clean.  
On this model, I especially like the control bar for the heat settings.  Unlike my old freestanding cooker where I had to repeatedly press a plus/minus arrow to change the temperature setting and to switch the hob off; this hob has the option to directly select one of the ‘pre-set’ temperatures (1, 3, 5, 8 10).  I found this to be far less fiddly than my previous model and a good improvement. 
In addition to the pre-set, you have the option to select additional temperatures by moving your finger along the slide bar.  By pressing 0, the cooking zone is switched off.
As with my other hobs, I love the option of being able to set a count down timer when using the cooking zones.  Set the timer and the zone automatically counts down then switches off.  No more exploding boiled eggs! 
Another great feature is the ‘pause’ setting.  By pressing this, the cooking zones switch to the lowest heat setting.  Great if you need to leave the hob for any length of time as it will stop the food from burning.  I also like the residual heat indicator, this is a good visual safety feature.
The hob brings water to the boil speedily by using the ‘power boost’.  Also, the hob is very responsive when reducing heat down to a simmer.
I didn’t find this hob especially noisy when in operation.
With regards to other comments that they find the bleeping a nuisance, you do have the option to switch the sounds off.
This hob comes with a Hob2Hood function.  As I do not have a compatible extractor hood, I am unable to comment on this function.  Though, I do think this is a good idea.
Overall, I have found this hob very easy to use and the controls are simple to navigate.  There is no need to keep referring back to the manual as the design and functions have not been over complicated.  The layout is well thought out and functions are easy to select.",Approved

Love it lots. Quiet and efficient. Easy to use. Clear simple display.

"This is the first induction hob i have ever used and i can honestly say i love it , Not only is it lovely to look at , its extremely easy to use and
has cut down the time it takes to boil vegetables
I have not got rid of my electric kettle and brought a good solid induction hob kettle , the water boils so much faster then in the electric one , so its also money saving ,
Its touch control is fab it is amazingly responsive and so easy to change the temperature of the heat ,it can be a bit fiddly at first but once your use to it its easy
The hob is very easy to clean always looking new and shiny
Its has a safety feature that can tell if you have forgotten to turn it off and automatically switches off , it also cools as soon as you lift the pan
making it safe for little hands if you have little ones
over all this makes cooking an enjoyable experience",Approved

"My family and I were delighted that AEG selected us to receive a free product in return for an honest review of its performance, which is what I will attempt to do.
It really goes without saying that as ever this AEG product features sleek design, is high quality and delivers all of the features you could wish for and a few more besides.
It copes excellently with the standard features one expects from a conventional fan oven and meets our families everyday needs and wants. What sets it apart are some of the unique features that you would not normally enjoy.
Its fair to say that in its first few weeks of use we were unable to really build up much that needed cleaning, but we did try Pyrolytic cleaning, which was quite easy, though some shelves do need to be removed before starting.
The oven returned it to as new condition, but, what really impressed us were the safety features, especially locking it shut during the process. This oven gets REALLY hot, which would be dangerous with kids in the house, we were really impressed that this had been considered and felt safe and reassured.
The second unique feature is the 25% steam function, on first reading about this we were unconvinced and thought it could be a bit of a 'gadget', but, we were actually very surprised that it really did add something to our meals.
We were most surprised about baking, since this is really about drying out the wet ingredients and adding steam seems counter intuitive. How wrong we were! Our cakes were a lot better than in any previous fan oven that we had.
Our 8 year daughter put it to a scientific test, cooking two batches of Xmas Tree shaped muffins, from the same mixture, one with steam one without. The second batch with steam noticeably rose further and faster during baking, and whilst the finished products ended up a similar size, those with Steam were a bit lighter and had that really pleasing cracked surface you get on muffins in professional coffee shops.
So far we love the oven, our only grumble is that the steam is so good it would be better to have the oven directly connected to the mains supply, with a permanent waste to drain the water, as filling can be a bit messy.",Approved

"I was selected by the manufacturer to receive a free product in return for an honest review. I received the AEG Pyrolytic Combination Steam Oven BP5014321M which replaced my 2 year Indesit electric fan oven. To be honest I had never heard of a Steam Oven until I got this - but all I really need to say is it's amazing!

We were going to a party and often bring along a few kilos of pulled pork. It’s normally cooked in the slow cooker over 8 hours and it's still hit and miss how tender it is. On this occasion we tried it in the oven, 2 x 2kg pork shoulders in one dish on the true fan setting over 4 hours, expecting it would need longer. However, it came out perfectly cooked and incredibly tender, probably the best we've made. The poor slow cooker has now retired to the attic.

Features – there’s a number of different options, which at first look daunting and meant the instructions were out for a few weeks but you soon remember them. The most important, in terms of cooking innovation, is the steam oven function. We’ve used it so many times and have found it perfect to do a juicy tender roast chicken, roast potatoes that are soft and fluffy on the inside but crispy on the outside, without having to be part boiled and brilliant Yorkshire puddings. Apart from the standard true fan oven settings there is also a really useful pizza setting which heats from the bottom of the oven to keep your pizza base crispy.

The oven also comes with a core temperature probe, which just before I’d got the oven I’d seen an Electrolux oven advert from the 50’s with the same thing and wondered where they had disappeared to. We used it to roast a mini mid-week beef joint – I like my beef rare and followed the instructions in the booklet. Compared to the suggested 50 minute cooking time on the packet the oven turned off in about 35 minutes, so I was a bit concerned it would be too rare, however it was cooked perfectly so I was pretty lucky otherwise it would have been well over done in 50.

Overall this is an amazing oven, packed full of features which will revolutionise the way you could cook but be prepared for some trial and error as everything cooks faster!",Approved

"Lovely oven. Looks very neat. Easy to use once you’ve read the instructions. Although indented oven shelves are a little awkward to lift trays off, they are a safety feature I can put up with as nothing slides off when you pull the shelf out.

"I received AEG L75480WD as part of the AEG review program in return for an honest product review.

I wanted to upgrade our current washer dryer from the AEG L75480WD to the L77695WD due to the increased capacity. The L77695WD takes a whopping 9kg!

I was uncertain of the silver band around the top, it seemed a bit new-fangled, although after installation it looked very smart and gives the whole unit a little more class.

Turning it on I was pleased to hear the re-assuring beeps I had become accustomed to still present but a much softer sound. The door closes firmly and when a wash begins it gives a gentle whirr. I’m happy to say it feels more refined and solid, where engineers somewhere have made the little things pleasing.

I started with a quick 20min wash with a few woollen jumpers. It is incredibly quiet! Usually I do laundry overnight, it’s awesome waking up to fresh laundry. Being so quiet it has not disturbed our sleep once.

When it came to a larger load, I put a weeks worth of darks in. I was surprised to see the wash/dry time come up as 7.45, however it didn’t take this long. The dryer measures the dampness of it contents and adjusts the program to suit. I find longer garments such as shirt arms got tangled.

For formal wear I use the iron dry mode where items come out ever so slightly damp, perfect for hanging and ironing.

Importantly everything I have put in so far has come out clean and dry.

My tiny niggle is when cycle is complete the soft beep sounds in five to six cycles of three. You can’t change this; it is either on or off.

Laundry is now incredibly easy.",Approved

"This is the second hob of this model that we have purchased for our new kitchen in our new home.
We have now kitted our three kitchens with AEG products. This is a great looking hob: its sleek, slim lined and with touch sensitive controls. The layout of the ""rings"" is such that a vast array of pan sizes can be used. It has rapid heat up. It is very easy to clean and always looks clean and shiny.",Approved
"We bought this as a direct replacement for a Stoves hob which had lasted 9 years. Their features are pretty similar but we're still on a learning curve where there are operational differences. We are slowly getting used to the ""slider"" type heat controls but we preferred the ""up/down"" controls on our old hob. Similarly, we have trouble using the bottom rings without accidentally changing settings on the control panel - if that persists I guess we'll have to start using the ""lock"" feature. Overall we're pleased with but not astounded by our new hob and just hope it turns out to be reliable.",Approved

"Despite an increased insulation the appliance is remarkably spacious. The transparent drawers are a very good feature and allows prompt access to the organised interior. The family have become quite familiar with the arrangement of the interior and are not tempted to rummage around the contents. The appliance is very quiet and, despite its size, is very unobtrusive.
The light is an excellent feature.",Approved
"Works well, and the drawers on rollers are a very good idea",Approved
This product is very roomy you can see everything you want inside and so easy to keep clean. We had an LG Fridge/freezer compared to the AEG the LG was rubbish in comparison.,Approved
We only found this built in frost free freezer. Others did not have this feature.,Approved
"Have always bought Bosch but in March 2016 invested significantly in a new kitchen and went for AEG for all the appliances - had issues with the fridge freezer within 6 months and this integrated freezer has just died - huge amounts of ice, alarming constantly and the motor now sounding like its exploding. So for an appliance at this price - it really isn't worth it",Approved
Good frost free. Nice drawers and storage. Quality build. Handy alarms.,Approved
"battery might be long lasting but it fails after 16 months. Out of warranty it will cost £90

After sales service is the worst ever. cannot get through, fail to reply, pass you on and on. Other makes may have longer warranty.

Electrolux group at its worst.

Last time I ever buy Electrolux.",Rejected
"replacement for older AEG model (4 years old), at present its working well but as with all electrical equipment they can break quickly",Approved
This is a good freezer but basic features. It is a great size but drawers not very deep,Rejected
"What kind of dumb thick designer puts an off switch on a freezer so if you lean against it you end up turning it off. Why would I ever want to turn off my freezer, and if I ever really needed to then pulling out the plug is so simple. Product designers seem to get dumber by the day.",Approved
"So pleased that I chose to buy this freezer. Just can't be faulted!
Frost free,quiet,no internal shelves so loads of storage space, even for a turkey!!!! 
Presently filling up with the fruits and veg from the garden and supermarket offers, so worth while buying this 2nd freezer.",Approved
Good Quality for the price paid. Performs well. Door handle would be better if it were recessed but this does not distract from the overall rating. Build is more robust that the only other under counter freezers currently available.,Approved

"This is a real shame. Its a great looking toaster but is let down by poor design. The toast will not go deep enough into the slot to enable the entire slice to be toasted. Even with Toastie bread led on its side, the top 1/4 is not toasted. You get a nice toast on the bottom 3/4 and warm bread on the top 1/4.",Approved
"The slots on the toaster are not long enough to take standard English loaf

Very nice Owen war of the price thank you very much you make something like that,Approved
So simple to use and easy to clean. The steam function is brilliant for any joints of meat. Best oven I've purchased by far.,Approved
Knobs difficult to adjust nothing temperature and mode.,Approved
"Wish we purchased a AEG oven before our last purchase far better to use and understand instructions 
Brilliant buy",Approved
"Comparing this to the self cleaning oven I had in Canada - this one doesn't self clean!

On this one you have to take out all the stainless steel fittings (and there are a lot) and the pan at the bottom to clean them by hand. It takes longer to do that than for the remainder of the oven to ""self clean"". The maximum it will clean for is 90 minutes. That compares to the Canadian oven where everything got left in to be cleaned it cleaned #on its fastest setting) for 3 hours.

This oven leaves things untouched around the door and even when the see-through part of the door is cleaned as per the instructions it still needs to be cleaned afterwards to remove what is now baked on. I am hoping it dies a death soon so I can get an oven that does what it says - self cleans.",Approved
"I received AEG BP5014321M as part of the AEG review program in return for an honest product review.

Previously I have had some top brand ovens but have been underwhelmed, they have never cooked evenly, and when your other half is a crazy baker, you need something that works properly. Rest assured the first 48 cupcakes made went in and came out perfectly, meringue are spot on, slightly soft in the middle and crunchy on the outside and lightly bronzed.

The AEG BP5014321M is a great oven, it has a large very large capacity for it’s size, I had ample room to get the Sunday roast in, including potatoes, Yorkshire puds, pigs in blankets and a good sized bird. I did a whole roast with large bird in 1 hour 40 on the steam setting – I could have cut this down to 1.20 if I put the potatoes in on time! Importantly everything seems to cook well. The other bonus is the steam keeps a chicken moist – it came out so flavoursome and succulent.

I really like that the timer starts from when you turn the oven on, so you always know how long the oven has been on for – I have never had that function but it is really useful. I also like the heat probe for cooking a joint – it has really helped me cook roast beef to my preferred medium.

Lastly the oven heats up really quickly, and you can see the current temperature as it’s warming up. The defrost mode is also great for proving bread or pizza dough.

The oven is packed with features I never expected and is by far the best oven I have owned and I’m so impressed with it I have bought one for my Mother as an early xmas present - she too is a very keen baker.",Approved

Attempting to use the oven in new kitchen for first time Easter Sunday.. realised the control dial wasn't interacting with display so therefore quite unusable. Have a engineer coming following week so will see how things progress,Approved
"So easy to use as compared to standard cleaners. Has to be emptied frequently, but as this is simple its not a problem. with the hand held option stairs are no longer a problem. A bit noisy but manageable. Excelent design in the field of so many other designs, especially in its low weight.",Approved
Very happy with my purchase. Very light and easy to use.,Approved
"We have been using this new built-in oven for the past few weeks and it has been giving us very good results in all the settings that we have currently used. We have had a self cleaning oven or a long time before so look forward to trying out the self cleaning function on this new model. The interior finishes are much superior compared to our old oven.
Lets hope it lasts as long as the last unit did, time will tell.",Approved
Fast and exclusive look. Very good working order. Instructions bit too long windowed but getting through it,Approved
"Well made oven with spacious interior. Easy to use electronic menus. The oven has many features and we have yet to explore them all. The temperature control is near perfect, and the fast heat setting is excellent. So far we are very impressed and pleased with this oven.",Approved
"What a brilliant machine. Light to use, and I particularly like the hair cutter (I have long hair) Very useful to have a detachable part for furniture.",Approved
Everything about the oven is good. I have a few gripes though and one is that the instruction book is a bit complicated and not clear enough. I wish there were a few recipes in it just so I know that I am using the correct settings!,Approved
Absolutely brilliant piece of kit. Takes cooking to a new level,Approved

"Having looked and considered for months about which cordless vacuum would be best for us we discovered this. The price was good, better at John Lewis than at other retailers. It's light, easy to use and can be quickly deployed every day for pet hairs.
There is a little issue of not being able to get beneath one of the cupboards because the 'head' is not as flat as our previous corded cleaner. However, we have a strategy for this. We are very satisfied.",Rejected
Controls can take a little time to learn but I’m finding no fault with it. The doors are nice and solid and there is no heat loss brilliant,Approved

"Selected the AEG double oven unit over Bosch units as build quality appeared superior.
In service it has been excellent. Really pleased.",Approved
This oven has changed my life in a good way. I'm loving cooking now.,Approved
"The oven really looks the business, after using it for a month i am quite happy but not exstatic. Only one thing thats bugging me and if AEG addressed this it would be so much better, the round control knobs that pop out are very difficult to read unless you are 6foot 6 inches tall. Please address this and you have a winner.",Approved
"Cleans brilliantly and is extremely quiet. Great range of programmes and they all do a good job.

The only gripe is the internal layout of the trays. They are not easy to stack and make it a bit harder to get loads in. The top is particularly difficult.

It works almost as good as a gas stove! It heats up from cold very very quickly.,Approved
Cleans the contents really well no issues and Like that you can barely hear that the machine is on,Approved
The instruction booklet is far from clear. Very hard to comprehend.,Approved
"Was received as part of an insurance replacement policy and I have not received any complaints in 3 weeks of use from my tenant. 

It replaced an 11 year old Zanussi washer dryer, so I hope it can equal or surpass that amount of duration in use.

I think the drum door is massive and the control panel and dial intuitive to use.

Ideal for 2 people in a flat who have busy lives.",Approved
"Good quality product. Does the job well, albeit some programs are too restrictive in term of weight they can handle.",Approved
I love the large sliding vegetable drawer and the small door pocket which could have been wasted space which is ideal for herbs. It has great capacity.,Approved
"The wollen cycle option is amazing, even washed my cashmere safetly. Even better than me hand washing myself!",Approved
Several features of our old cooker were becoming irritating and having purchased the AEG we have been highly delighted with its performance. The top oven is excellent as it gives the correct cooking temperature for the gas number. The large oven has the ability to cook food at the same time at slightly different temperatures at top and bottom positions. The hob is well designed - pans are held securely on the pan racks.,Approved
The only problem is we have found is sometimes the oven decides to switches off after couple minutes and you have to re-light also on also we have one of the rings once lit goes out then works perfectly another time after a couple hours,Approved
"It took me a long time to find a cooker I wanted when my old one broke down after 17 years! 
So I recently purchased this cooker and I am really pleased with the quality and performance.
It is very solid and the wok burner is excellent if you are using a large frying or saute pan.
The only problem I have found so far is the guards at the back of the shelves restricting some positioning .
The top oven is really useful and I use this far more than the bottom oven.
I would recommend it - I am very fussy!",Approved
"This is the first time I've bought a cooker of such quality it's well built and cooks to a professional standard .
The controls are easy to use and cleaning is effortless it looks great and is a must have in any moden kitchen",Approved
asd fadsf asdf aa dfasdf asdf asdf asdf asdf ad dfadsf asdf asdf asdf,Approved
"Does what it says.
Fast and efficient ceramic job which retains the heat for a long time when switched off reducing fuel usage.
Oven has multiple cooking options which is very useful - oven is also very quiet.
Good self cleaning linings with a light in both top and main oven 
Programmable timer took a little while to sort out but have now managed this and use it frequently - this is one of the reasons I chose this model",Approved
"good engineering and construction, no flimsy buttons though i would prefer better ""feel"" to the rotary controls 
temperature control is accurate however for me too many oven settings
doors are triple glazed, where else will you get the protection",Approved
A good cooker best one i have had yet the hob heats up fast and the oven is just as fast to get up to temp,Approved
I was influenced by a good rating in Which? and the cooker has lived up to all expectations,Approved

Only downside are the legs are flimsy when adjusting to height of worktops. Make sure your saucepans work on the induction hob. Overall an excellent product and well built and I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to update their cooker,Approved
Had my cooker for a couple of weeks now and I am finding it a dream to cook on. Love the induction hob as it is as quick as gas. Still lots to learn but having fun.,Approved

"The cooker looks and feels amazing with high tech and easy to control functions once you get the hang of it. My wife was unsure how to work it but soon became comfortable with the general operations.
Ensure you read the handbook and keep close by for the first few days of use 
Overall it’s an amazing cooker that heats fast , cooks incredible and is so easy to keep clean . 
No regrets in purchasing such an expensive cooker . Nice one AEG",Approved
"The cooker has excellent facilities and is really good value , a step forward on our previous Electrolux (10 years old), for which this is the direct replacement.

We have used all facilities over the last 2 weeks, and they all provide all we need for a 5 person household and an adventurous cook. 

On delivery, the rear right hob zone did not work on setting ""9"", requiring an AEG call out under warranty . AEG's repair contractors were very good and fitted a new switch - which solved the problem. Disappointing that a brand new product should have a defect.",Rejected
"We had looked at many cookers in various stores but none were as good as this one. This offers great space, fantastic features and good value for money. My only gripe is the timer, it is a pain to use. Have tried a few times but have now gone back to using the one on my phone, much simpler.",Approved
"Really lovely cooker. Solid build and robust features. Makes a nice change that means my food is cooked in the time allotted at the temperature stated. Very roomy top and main ovens, generous sized burners and it’s a great feature to have the shelf runners, too. Love having the extra shelf and the option of using the grill pan as an extra shelf.
Overall, it’s definitely a step up for me.",Approved

I love the sliding shelf feature in the oven which can be used at any height. Changed from an electric hob and it's so fast in comparison to heat anything. Kept the electric oven though.,Approved
"Fantastic cooker. I love everything about it. Both ovens, grill and hob all work like a dream, the cooker is solid and looks great.",Approved
"Nice looking cooker, slots in well
Knobs could have been metalised instead of plastic, it does cheapen looks.
Used top oven most and satisfactory results, heats and cooks well without burning. 
Only used bottom oven once and it didn't seem as hot, as top oven on same setting and food took longer to cook.
Big disadvantage the fan doesn't cut out on opening door and steam /heat billows out.

"I selected this machine because it was made by AEG and because it had good independent reviews elsewhere. Apart from its prowess as a cooker, it is very well made and has outstanding design characteristics. Since taking ownership and having used it fully and extensively over the Christmas/New Year period it has never failed to perform beyond expectations. I am particularly impressed with the performance of the induction hob, my first experience with this type. I cannot emphasise how extraordinarily responsive and flexible it is for temperature control and that fact alone sells this cooker to me. No other cooker that I have ever used in more than 50 years experience has impressed me in the way that this has - and I have demanding standards!",Approved
